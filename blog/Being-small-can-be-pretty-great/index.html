                    content: "Welcome back to Mastiff Systems’ Cybersecurity Essentials series. Last week, we demystified what a network is and how to protect the network and devices where your data flows. This week, we’re diving into password best practices, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and account hygiene — your core defenses that help safeguard your systems against unauthorized access.Why You Should CareA breach in account security can mean unauthorized access to sensitive client data, medical records, or confidential legal documents. Beyond data loss, it can lead to reputational damage, regulatory fines, and even lawsuits.Passwords are the first line of defense for nearly every system your business relies on — email, applications, file servers, Wi-Fi, and more. Yet, they remain one of the weakest links in cybersecurity. Combine that with poor account hygiene — like failing to revoke access for former employees or sharing credentials — and you’re just one exposed password away from a serious breach.According to 2019 research, weak or compromised passwords were the third leading cause of ransomware attacks, following lack of employee training and phishing.If you’re curious about the scale of these threats, here are links to public databases that track real-world breach incidents in the USA:  Medical Data Breaches (U.S.): HHS OCR Breach Portal  General Data Breaches (All Industries): Privacy Rights Clearinghouse  California-Specific Breach Notices: California Attorney General Breach ListReal-World Examples      McDonald’s McHire Chatbot (2025)Researchers discovered the admin account used the default password “123456,” exposing data of 64 million job applicants.        SolarWinds Breach (2020)Attackers accessed systems using a weak, publicly exposed password: “solarwinds123.” This led to a global supply-chain attack affecting thousands of organizations.        Medibank (2022)An infected personal device synced with saved corporate credentials gave attackers access to Medibank’s email and VPN. 520 GB of sensitive data was stolen due to lack of MFA.  How Attackers Steal PasswordsBefore we talk defense, here’s how attackers gain access:  Brute-force attacks: Rapidly guessing combinations until one works  Credential stuffing: Reusing stolen credentials from other breaches  Phishing: Tricking users into entering passwords on fake websites  Social engineering: Impersonating trusted people to extract credentials  Password spraying: Trying common passwords across many accountsOnce in, attackers may install malware, steal client data, or escalate their privileges — especially dangerous if MFA is not enabled.Best Practices for Passwords, MFA &amp; Account SecurityHere’s how to build strong defenses around your accounts:Use Strong, Unique Passwords  At least 12–16 characters  Mix of letters, numbers, symbols  Avoid names, dates, or reused passwords  Use passphrases for memorability (e.g., Correct-Battery-Staple)Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  Adds a second layer beyond your password  Use authenticator apps (Microsoft, Google) or hardware keys (YubiKey)  Avoid relying only on SMS or email for MFAPractice Good Account Hygiene  Audit access regularly — remove old or unused accounts  Apply least privilege — give only what’s necessary  Avoid shared accounts — each user should have their own  Monitor for suspicious login activityUse a Password Manager  Generates and stores strong passwords  Avoid storing passwords in spreadsheets or sticky notesPasswordless Login: A Safer FutureModern platforms (Google, Apple, Microsoft) are moving toward passwordless login. Instead of typing a password, you authenticate with:  Passkeys (Face ID, fingerprint, or device PIN)  Magic Links (email or SMS links for one-click login)  Biometric loginsThis approach is phishing-resistant, harder to steal, and improves user experience. Adoption is growing rapidly.A Deeper Dive: The CIA TriadThe foundation of cybersecurity is built on the CIA Triad — not the agency, but the principles:  Confidentiality: Keep data private and protected  Integrity: Prevent unauthorized changes  Availability: Ensure data and systems are accessible when neededPasswords, MFA, and account hygiene are all about confidentiality — preventing unauthorized access to your business’s sensitive information.Final ThoughtsPasswords may feel basic, but they’re central to protecting your business. Combined with MFA and good account hygiene, they form a critical first line of defense.But even the strongest passwords won’t help if someone is tricked into giving them away.Next week, we’ll tackle Social Engineering &amp; AI Threats — how attackers use deception, not just technology, to breach your systems.Stay tuned!",

                    url: "/blog/How-setup-power-monitoring-virtual-machine/",
                    content: "Monitoring power consumption is crucial for making smarter decisions, reducing costs, and promoting sustainability—whether in a data center, smart home, or renewable energy project. A power monitoring virtual machine (VM) simplifies this process by providing a centralized platform to collect, analyze, and visualize energy data.In this blog, we’ll walk you through setting up a power monitoring VM, covering essential tools, software, and configurations to streamline your energy management. Let’s get started and optimize your power monitoring setup!Prerequisites      Virtual Machine Host  You’ll need either VMware ESXi or Proxmox Virtual Environment installed on your server.        UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)  Your UPS should have either a USB or Ethernet port for communication.      Virtual Machine Image  Typically downloadable from the manufacturer’s website, usually in .VMDK format.System Overview  In this example setup:      We have a physical server connected to the UPS using both power and data via USB.        A hypervisor (ESXi or Proxmox) is already installed.        We’ll use the manufacturer’s utility image to deploy the power monitoring VM.    ⚠️ Note: The monitoring system used in this guide supports VMware ESXi only.  Procedures for VMWare        Verify UPS Detection via SSH    - Login to your VMware host through SSH.                      At the prompt, type lsusb. This command will list all USB devices connected to your physical server.                      Download the VMDK image from the manufacturer’s website    For this example, the UPS manufacturer is Cyber Power Systems.    - If your UPS is connected via USB, download the first option.    - If your UPS is connected via the network, download the second (remote) option.                  After downloadingUnzip the file to extract the necessary image files.      Login to the VMware web GUI and create a virtual machine.    Select Deploy a virtual machine from an OVF or OVA file, then click Next.                      Enter the name of the virtual machine (e.g., MonitorVM).    - Drag and drop the .ovf and .vmdk files into the box.    - Click Next once they are loaded.                            Choose the storage location.    For this example, we only have one option. Click Next.                      Select Thin Provisioning.    - Untick Power on automatically.    - Click Next.                      Review the configuration and click Finish.                      Wait for the virtual machine to finish creating.                      Configure the power monitoring VM.    - Add a USB device to the VM.    - Choose your UPS from the list.    - Click Save.                                  Turn on the virtual machine.    Take note of the IP address automatically assigned by ESXi.                      Access the web GUI.    Open a browser and enter the IP address with the correct port (e.g., http://10.11.0.124:3052).    Refer to the manufacturer’s manual to determine the correct port.                            Change the default password (mandatory).    After clicking Save, you will be logged out and must log in again with your new password.                            After logging in, you'll see complete UPS information on the left-hand side.                      Configure shutdown settings.    Navigate to Settings &gt; Shutdown Events.    - Verify connectivity to your ESXi server.    - Set your preferred shutdown duration and delay.                      Click Apply to save your shutdown configurations.                Procedures for Proxmox      In Proxmox, select your PVE node → Shell.     Or use your favorite remote connection tool to connect to your proxmox server. List all USB ports by typing lsusb          Note the Bus and Device of your UPS device.                 List the USB port details:   lsusb -v -s [bus]:[device]   in my case   lsusb -v -s 1:16                      We have to download PowerPanel Business                  We are going to download PowerPanel Business – Virtual Machine (Local) since the UPS is connected directly to our bare-metal server.                     Extract the zipped file to reveal its contents.    We will need the .OVF and .VMDK files later.                      We are going to upload the .OVF and .VMDK files to our Proxmox server using SFTP or FTP software such as FileZilla, WinSCP, etc. In our case, we will use WinSCP. Once downloaded, install it to your device.    Upload the .OVF and .VMDK files to the Proxmox server.Using WinSCP, log in to your Proxmox server and proceed with the upload.                                    Create the virtual machine for CyberPower PowerPanel.In the Proxmox shell, navigate to the directory where you uploaded the .OVF and .VMDK files.              We are now ready to create the virtual machine using the following command format:qm importovf &lt;proxmox ID&gt; &lt;ovf source&gt; &lt;storage&gt; --format &lt;format&gt;  qm – Command that creates/restores a VM  importovf – Imports virtual machines from an OVF (Open Virtualization Format) or OVA (Open Virtual Appliance) package into a hypervisor or virtualization platform  proxmox ID – Assigns a unique Proxmox ID for the virtual machine  ovf source – The path to the OVF source file  storage – Specifies the storage where the virtual machine will reside  --format – Sets the disk format (e.g., raw, qcow2, vmdk)For our case, qm importovf 106 ppb4113-local.ovf local-lvm --format raw              Upon entering the command, the system will display the progress of the VM creation. Wait until it reaches 100%.                  Add a virtual network card and connect the UPS to the VMThe virtual machine is not complete yet—we need to add a virtual network card so we can assign it an IP address later.                                          Check the Manufacturer and Product ID, then select Add.                                Assign an IP address to PowerPanelTurn on the newly created virtual machine.              Since we don't have a working IP address yet, we will assign one using DHCP.First, type ip add to identify the label of the attached network card.              Next, we will activate ens18 by typing the following command:sudo ip link set dev ens18 up              We will assign an IP address automatically using the following command:sudo dhclient -v ens18Upon entering this command, the system will display the assigned IP address.                 Access PowerPanel using the assigned IP address and port 3052Using a browser, we can now access PowerPanel by entering the assigned IP address followed by the port number.In our case, it should be:192.168.5.102:3052                      Upon logging in, the system will prompt you to change the password.Changing the password is mandatory.

      <p>Maybe it’s a human trait, but we are obsessed with growth. We always seem to want to be moving to the next thing. Is it just how we are wired? For the next dopamine fix? Now don’t get me wrong, growth certainly is positive but is it the end all be all? We go to endless lengths just to show growth in a single quarter. If there isn’t constant growth then shareholders get restless and CEOs lose their jobs. But sometimes the whole thing seems downright silly.</p>

<p>Let me give you a recent example. Last quarter, Apple posted profits of $89.5 billion. That’s an insane amount of money. No one is going to call that a bad business but since they did $90.1 billion that quarter the year before their stock price went down, $89.5 billion in the bank wasn’t good enough and investors got spooked because “maybe they are going down”. It’s pure madness.</p>

<p>This mindless endless focus at all costs has created a terrible problem in our society where humans are treated like resources to grow a business and not humans that have value in their own right. The term “human capital” became a thing. The business will do about anything to be as profitable as possible. In 2014, Americans for Tax Fairness published a document titled “Walmart on Tax Day: How Taxpayers Subsidize America’s Biggest Employer and Richest Family.” According to the report, Walmart receives approximately $6.2 billion each year in predominantly federal taxpayer subsidies. This is attributed to the fact that Walmart’s low employee wages result in many of them depending on government assistance programs such as food stamps, Medicaid, and six other taxpayer-funded initiatives. How can anyone call this ethical? But Walmart is considered a great business and a sound investment. This seems so wrong, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Why not focus on being the best you possibly can be? Going deep for your clients or customers? Why not try to add more value to your product offerings at every step? Why not treat clients like partners in building something rather than only a resource to make a profit?</p>

<p>This is one of the things I saw happening in the IT industry that I didn’t like at all. The term is called managed services. There is nothing inherently wrong with managed services and sometimes it’s the absolute right thing. But it doesn’t seem to be a very client-forward perspective. Typically you get charged per month per computer you have regardless of whether you have done any work with that computer or not. They charge simply to monitor everything. Sometimes it’s worth it, but often it isn’t. I struggled personally with the concept of getting paid without really offering much value. Certainly monitoring services have value, but to charge a monthly fee on a computer that will never be worked on just seemed wrong. That’s one of the things we do differently at Mastiff by design. We view each client as unique and custom-build solutions each time. Of course, there is overlap, but technology is there to serve the needs of the business, not the other way around. Technology is simply a tool and a tool that should be shaped to the needs of the user.</p>

<p>It’s customary in Japanese businesses to do a 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 100-year business plan. Now, of course, planning for 100 years in the future doesn’t make much sense. But it’s a great thought exercise. Am I building a long-lasting company that provides real value to people or am I looking for a quick payout? Now there is nothing wrong with either approach but we choose the former. Let’s build something that lasts. This is why we choose slow organic growth. This allows us to go in deep with a client’s needs and help them on a different level rather than just “fixing a computer”. Technology is an amazing tool that can give your business a competitive advantage. So let’s harness it.</p>

<p>Once the business is making the money that everyone needs to have the lifestyle they want, why artificially pump it full of hormones? Why go into debt just for the sake of growth? As long as you aren’t saddled with debt (Mastiff has never taken on debt ever) you are growing the financial assets and everyone is making great wages then improve yourself first. Improve the business and then the growth will come. We chose to stay small on purpose for these reasons. We like calling our shots. We like not having the headaches of being a large company. We like being able to turn on a dime and follow new technology where it leads. We like spending extra time with clients when we can. If we only focused on growth then metrics like ticket close time and turnaround time become more important than connecting, understanding, and real collaboration. It doesn’t seem worth it from here.</p>

I"i<p>I have two of my kids on my car insurance since it’s cheaper for them, so they pay
me directly for it every month rather than pay the bill themselves. I also had them
on my phone plan up until recently. But it’s easy to forget to request that payment
and the kids certainly aren’t motivated to remember. Certainly there was a way to
automate this?</p>

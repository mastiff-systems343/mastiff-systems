Monitoring power consumption is essential for making smarter decisions, reducing costs, and promoting sustainability—whether you're managing a data center, a smart home, or a renewable energy project. A power monitoring virtual machine (VM) simplifies this process by offering a centralized platform to collect, analyze, and visualize energy data.

In this blog, we'll walk you through setting up a power monitoring VM, covering essential tools, software, and configurations to streamline your energy management. Let’s get started and optimize your setup!

**Prerequisites**
  - Virtual Machine Host
  You’ll need either VMware ESXi or Proxmox Virtual Environment installed on your server.

  - UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)
  Your UPS should have either a USB or Ethernet port for communication.

  - Virtual Machine Image
  Typically downloadable from the manufacturer’s website, usually in .VMDK format.

**System Overview**

In this example setup:

  - We have a physical server connected to the UPS using both power and data via USB.

  - A hypervisor (ESXi or Proxmox) is already installed.  

  - We’ll use the manufacturer’s utility image to deploy the power monitoring VM.
  
    ⚠️ Note: The monitoring system used in this guide supports VMware ESXi only.

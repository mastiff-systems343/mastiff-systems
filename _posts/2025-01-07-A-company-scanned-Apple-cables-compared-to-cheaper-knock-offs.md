This is one reason Apple gets a reputation for being more “expensive” but you
can’t tell me those are the same cables. You really do get what you pay for here in
both speed and longer term reliability. Job’s famously said “Apple doesn’t know
how to make junk” and despite a few missteps here and there, this seems true.
When it comes to technology the devils in the details and Apple does detail better
than anyone.
I’m sure they have good margin on these, of course. But it’s not the highway
robbery people think it is.

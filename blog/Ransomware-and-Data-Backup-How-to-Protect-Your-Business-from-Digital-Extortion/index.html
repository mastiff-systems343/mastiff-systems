                    content: "Welcome back to Mastiff Systems’ Cybersecurity Essentials series. Last week, we demystified what a network is and how to protect the network and devices where your data flows. This week, we’re diving into password best practices, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and account hygiene — your core defenses that help safeguard your systems against unauthorized access.Why You Should CareA breach in account security can mean unauthorized access to sensitive client data, medical records, or confidential legal documents. Beyond data loss, it can lead to reputational damage, regulatory fines, and even lawsuits.Passwords are the first line of defense for nearly every system your business relies on — email, applications, file servers, Wi-Fi, and more. Yet, they remain one of the weakest links in cybersecurity. Combine that with poor account hygiene — like failing to revoke access for former employees or sharing credentials — and you’re just one exposed password away from a serious breach.According to 2019 research, weak or compromised passwords were the third leading cause of ransomware attacks, following lack of employee training and phishing.If you’re curious about the scale of these threats, here are links to public databases that track real-world breach incidents in the USA:  Medical Data Breaches (U.S.): HHS OCR Breach Portal  General Data Breaches (All Industries): Privacy Rights Clearinghouse  California-Specific Breach Notices: California Attorney General Breach ListReal-World Examples      McDonald’s McHire Chatbot (2025)Researchers discovered the admin account used the default password “123456,” exposing data of 64 million job applicants.        SolarWinds Breach (2020)Attackers accessed systems using a weak, publicly exposed password: “solarwinds123.” This led to a global supply-chain attack affecting thousands of organizations.        Medibank (2022)An infected personal device synced with saved corporate credentials gave attackers access to Medibank’s email and VPN. 520 GB of sensitive data was stolen due to lack of MFA.  How Attackers Steal PasswordsBefore we talk defense, here’s how attackers gain access:  Brute-force attacks: Rapidly guessing combinations until one works  Credential stuffing: Reusing stolen credentials from other breaches  Phishing: Tricking users into entering passwords on fake websites  Social engineering: Impersonating trusted people to extract credentials  Password spraying: Trying common passwords across many accountsOnce in, attackers may install malware, steal client data, or escalate their privileges — especially dangerous if MFA is not enabled.Best Practices for Passwords, MFA &amp; Account SecurityHere’s how to build strong defenses around your accounts:Use Strong, Unique Passwords  At least 12–16 characters  Mix of letters, numbers, symbols  Avoid names, dates, or reused passwords  Use passphrases for memorability (e.g., Correct-Battery-Staple)Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  Adds a second layer beyond your password  Use authenticator apps (Microsoft, Google) or hardware keys (YubiKey)  Avoid relying only on SMS or email for MFAPractice Good Account Hygiene  Audit access regularly — remove old or unused accounts  Apply least privilege — give only what’s necessary  Avoid shared accounts — each user should have their own  Monitor for suspicious login activityUse a Password Manager  Generates and stores strong passwords  Avoid storing passwords in spreadsheets or sticky notesPasswordless Login: A Safer FutureModern platforms (Google, Apple, Microsoft) are moving toward passwordless login. Instead of typing a password, you authenticate with:  Passkeys (Face ID, fingerprint, or device PIN)  Magic Links (email or SMS links for one-click login)  Biometric loginsThis approach is phishing-resistant, harder to steal, and improves user experience. Adoption is growing rapidly.A Deeper Dive: The CIA TriadThe foundation of cybersecurity is built on the CIA Triad — not the agency, but the principles:  Confidentiality: Keep data private and protected  Integrity: Prevent unauthorized changes  Availability: Ensure data and systems are accessible when neededPasswords, MFA, and account hygiene are all about confidentiality — preventing unauthorized access to your business’s sensitive information.Final ThoughtsPasswords may feel basic, but they’re central to protecting your business. Combined with MFA and good account hygiene, they form a critical first line of defense.But even the strongest passwords won’t help if someone is tricked into giving them away.Next week, we’ll tackle Social Engineering &amp; AI Threats — how attackers use deception, not just technology, to breach your systems.Stay tuned!",

                    url: "/blog/How-setup-power-monitoring-virtual-machine/",
                    content: "Monitoring power consumption is crucial for making smarter decisions, reducing costs, and promoting sustainability—whether in a data center, smart home, or renewable energy project. A power monitoring virtual machine (VM) simplifies this process by providing a centralized platform to collect, analyze, and visualize energy data.In this blog, we’ll walk you through setting up a power monitoring VM, covering essential tools, software, and configurations to streamline your energy management. Let’s get started and optimize your power monitoring setup!Prerequisites      Virtual Machine Host  You’ll need either VMware ESXi or Proxmox Virtual Environment installed on your server.        UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)  Your UPS should have either a USB or Ethernet port for communication.      Virtual Machine Image  Typically downloadable from the manufacturer’s website, usually in .VMDK format.System Overview  In this example setup:      We have a physical server connected to the UPS using both power and data via USB.        A hypervisor (ESXi or Proxmox) is already installed.        We’ll use the manufacturer’s utility image to deploy the power monitoring VM.    ⚠️ Note: The monitoring system used in this guide supports VMware ESXi only.  Procedures for VMWare        Verify UPS Detection via SSH    - Login to your VMware host through SSH.                      At the prompt, type lsusb. This command will list all USB devices connected to your physical server.                      Download the VMDK image from the manufacturer’s website    For this example, the UPS manufacturer is Cyber Power Systems.    - If your UPS is connected via USB, download the first option.    - If your UPS is connected via the network, download the second (remote) option.                  After downloadingUnzip the file to extract the necessary image files.      Login to the VMware web GUI and create a virtual machine.    Select Deploy a virtual machine from an OVF or OVA file, then click Next.                      Enter the name of the virtual machine (e.g., MonitorVM).    - Drag and drop the .ovf and .vmdk files into the box.    - Click Next once they are loaded.                            Choose the storage location.    For this example, we only have one option. Click Next.                      Select Thin Provisioning.    - Untick Power on automatically.    - Click Next.                      Review the configuration and click Finish.                      Wait for the virtual machine to finish creating.                      Configure the power monitoring VM.    - Add a USB device to the VM.    - Choose your UPS from the list.    - Click Save.                                  Turn on the virtual machine.    Take note of the IP address automatically assigned by ESXi.                      Access the web GUI.    Open a browser and enter the IP address with the correct port (e.g., http://10.11.0.124:3052).    Refer to the manufacturer’s manual to determine the correct port.                            Change the default password (mandatory).    After clicking Save, you will be logged out and must log in again with your new password.                            After logging in, you'll see complete UPS information on the left-hand side.                      Configure shutdown settings.    Navigate to Settings &gt; Shutdown Events.    - Verify connectivity to your ESXi server.    - Set your preferred shutdown duration and delay.                      Click Apply to save your shutdown configurations.                Procedures for Proxmox      In Proxmox, select your PVE node → Shell.     Or use your favorite remote connection tool to connect to your proxmox server. List all USB ports by typing lsusb          Note the Bus and Device of your UPS device.                 List the USB port details:   lsusb -v -s [bus]:[device]   in my case   lsusb -v -s 1:16                      We have to download PowerPanel Business                  We are going to download PowerPanel Business – Virtual Machine (Local) since the UPS is connected directly to our bare-metal server.                     Extract the zipped file to reveal its contents.    We will need the .OVF and .VMDK files later.                      We are going to upload the .OVF and .VMDK files to our Proxmox server using SFTP or FTP software such as FileZilla, WinSCP, etc. In our case, we will use WinSCP. Once downloaded, install it to your device.    Upload the .OVF and .VMDK files to the Proxmox server.Using WinSCP, log in to your Proxmox server and proceed with the upload.                                    Create the virtual machine for CyberPower PowerPanel.In the Proxmox shell, navigate to the directory where you uploaded the .OVF and .VMDK files.              We are now ready to create the virtual machine using the following command format:qm importovf &lt;proxmox ID&gt; &lt;ovf source&gt; &lt;storage&gt; --format &lt;format&gt;  qm – Command that creates/restores a VM  importovf – Imports virtual machines from an OVF (Open Virtualization Format) or OVA (Open Virtual Appliance) package into a hypervisor or virtualization platform  proxmox ID – Assigns a unique Proxmox ID for the virtual machine  ovf source – The path to the OVF source file  storage – Specifies the storage where the virtual machine will reside  --format – Sets the disk format (e.g., raw, qcow2, vmdk)For our case, qm importovf 106 ppb4113-local.ovf local-lvm --format raw              Upon entering the command, the system will display the progress of the VM creation. Wait until it reaches 100%.                  Add a virtual network card and connect the UPS to the VMThe virtual machine is not complete yet—we need to add a virtual network card so we can assign it an IP address later.                                          Check the Manufacturer and Product ID, then select Add.                                Assign an IP address to PowerPanelTurn on the newly created virtual machine.              Since we don't have a working IP address yet, we will assign one using DHCP.First, type ip add to identify the label of the attached network card.              Next, we will activate ens18 by typing the following command:sudo ip link set dev ens18 up              We will assign an IP address automatically using the following command:sudo dhclient -v ens18Upon entering this command, the system will display the assigned IP address.                 Access PowerPanel using the assigned IP address and port 3052Using a browser, we can now access PowerPanel by entering the assigned IP address followed by the port number.In our case, it should be:192.168.5.102:3052                      Upon logging in, the system will prompt you to change the password.Changing the password is mandatory.

      <p>Welcome back!</p>

<p>This article is part of Mastiff Systems’ ongoing Cybersecurity Essentials series, written specifically for small to medium-sized business owners and non-technical teams. Last week’s topic covered phishing and email security, one of the most common entry points for cyberattacks.</p>

<p>Today, we’re focusing on ransomware, a fast-growing threat that can lock your files, freeze your operations, and demand a hefty payment to get access back.</p>

<h4 id="why-you-should-care">Why You Should Care</h4>

<p>Ransomware doesn’t just affect large corporations. It’s increasingly hitting smaller organizations like dental clinics, law firms, and local service providers. These businesses are often more vulnerable because they don’t have advanced IT defenses, yet they store valuable data like patient records, legal documents, or financial files that attackers know you’ll pay to get back.</p>

<p>A ransomware attack can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lock you out of your own systems and files</li>
  <li>Force you to halt operations</li>
  <li>Damage client trust and your reputation</li>
  <li>Cost millions in ransom and even more in recovery</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re curious about the scale of these threats, here are links to public databases that track real-world breach incidents in the USA. There are around five new breaches reported every day, affecting businesses of all sizes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf">Medical Data Breaches (U.S.): HHS OCR Breach Portal</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://privacyrights.org/data-breaches">General Data Breaches (All Industries): Privacy Rights Clearinghouse</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/databreach/list">California-Specific Breach Notices: California Attorney General Breach List</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="real-world-examples">Real-World Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/healthtechsecurity/news/366594571/Dental-Care-Alliance-Reaches-3M-Proposed-Settlement-Over-Healthcare-Cyberattack">Dental Care Alliance (2020)</a></strong><br />
A ransomware attack on DSO Dental Care Alliance affected over 1 million patients. Hackers stole and encrypted sensitive patient data, leading to compliance issues and patient notifications under HIPAA, and agreed to a <strong>$3 million</strong> settlement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/ransomware-attack-on-law-firm-leads-to-data-breach/">Campbell Conroy &amp; O’Neil (2021)</a></strong><br />
A high-profile law firm was targeted. Ransomware locked up systems and compromised data from major corporate clients including Boeing, Pfizer, and ExxonMobil.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/us/baltimore-ransomware.html">City of Baltimore (2019)</a></strong><br />
A ransomware attack shut down most city systems including payments and email for weeks. The city refused to pay the <strong>$76,000</strong> ransom but ended up spending over <strong>$18 million</strong> in recovery.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-ransomware-works">How Ransomware Works</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Infection</strong><br />
A ransomware attack often starts when someone clicks a malicious link or downloads an infected attachment, usually from a phishing email, compromised website, or unpatched software with vulnerabilities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Encryption</strong><br />
Once inside your system, the malware locks (encrypts) files so you can’t access them. You’ll often see a pop-up message demanding a ransom, usually in cryptocurrency, in exchange for the decryption key.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Extortion</strong><br />
Some ransomware groups now steal your data before encrypting it. If you don’t pay, they threaten to leak it online, putting client confidentiality and regulatory compliance at risk.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="what-you-can-do-to-prevent-it">What You Can Do to Prevent It</h4>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Keep Backups And Test Them</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Make regular, automatic backups of your critical data.</li>
      <li>Use the 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies of your data, on 2 different types of media, with 1 stored off-site or in the cloud.</li>
      <li>Test your backups regularly. If you can’t restore, it’s not a real backup.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Train Staff on Phishing Awareness</strong><br />
Most ransomware infections come from email. Training your team to recognize phishing attempts is your first line of defense (see our second article for tips).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Patch Your Systems</strong><br />
Ransomware often exploits known software vulnerabilities. Always keep your operating systems, browsers, and applications up to date.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Limit User Permissions</strong><br />
Give employees access only to the files and systems they need. If ransomware infects a low-permission account, the damage is more contained.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Use Antivirus and Endpoint Protection</strong><br />
Modern antivirus software can block ransomware before it executes. Many systems now use AI to detect suspicious behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Segment Your Network</strong><br />
Don’t let one infected machine bring down your whole office. Separating devices and networks (e.g., admin vs. guest Wi-Fi) helps contain threats.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="what-to-do-after-a-ransomware-attack">What to Do After a Ransomware Attack</h4>

<p>Even with precautions in place, no system is 100% immune. If you’re hit by ransomware, follow these steps immediately:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Disconnect Affected Systems</strong><br />
Unplug or disconnect infected computers from the network to prevent the ransomware from spreading.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Contact Your IT Provider or Incident Response Team</strong><br />
If you have an IT team or have another IT partner, notify them right away. Don’t try to handle it alone unless you have in-house expertise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Don’t Pay the Ransom…Yet</strong><br />
Paying the ransom doesn’t guarantee your data will be restored and may encourage future attacks. Exhaust all recovery options first. Consult legal and cybersecurity professionals before deciding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Check Backups</strong><br />
Verify the integrity of your most recent backup and restore from a clean point before the infection. This is often the quickest and safest way to recover.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Report the Attack</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Notify the appropriate authorities:<br />
Report incidents to the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov">FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)</a> or the <a href="https://myservices.cisa.gov/irf">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</a></li>
      <li>Healthcare providers: If Protected Health Information (PHI) is involved, report the breach to the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa">U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS)</a> – Office for Civil Rights (OCR)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You may also need to notify clients or regulators, especially if sensitive data was exposed (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Change All Passwords</strong><br />
Assume passwords were compromised. Reset all system and email credentials, and enable MFA wherever possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Conduct a Postmortem</strong><br />
Understand how the attack happened and fix the gaps. Update security tools, conduct new training, and review your recovery plan.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h4>

<p>Ransomware is one of the most damaging cyber threats today. It encrypts your data, making it completely inaccessible until a ransom is paid (and even then, recovery isn’t guaranteed). But with strong backups, updated systems, and a well-prepared team, you can dramatically reduce your risk. And if the worst happens, knowing how to respond can make all the difference.</p>

<p><strong>In our next article</strong>, <em>Malware &amp; Software Updates</em>, we’ll cover a closely related topic: how outdated software and poor patching habits leave your business wide open to malware attacks and what you can do to prevent them.</p>

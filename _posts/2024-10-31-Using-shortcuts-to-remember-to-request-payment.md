I have two of my kids on my car insurance since it’s cheaper for them, so they pay
me directly for it every month rather than pay the bill themselves. I also had them
on my phone plan up until recently. But it’s easy to forget to request that payment
and the kids certainly aren’t motivated to remember. Certainly there was a way to
automate this?

My solution after a lot of trial and error was to use the shortcuts app to create an
automation to request the payment via Apple Pay.

As you can see for my kids. One shortcut each. Then I created a recurring
reminder with a link to the shortcut.

I get a pop up reminder on the first of every month, and I just click on the reminder
and it runs the shortcut and requests the money. The system works pretty well and
I haven’t forgotten to ask them since.

Before cloud computing had a name and virtualization was more than a whisper in the engine halls, Chris was already tuning the gears of innovation. He began his professional journey advising one of the world’s largest music technology companies, bridging sound and circuitry with insight and ingenuity. Years later, he ascended to Level III Systems Administrator for one of the biggest enterprises in America—where his command of infrastructure and systems became legendary.

Known across guilds for his strategic vision and mastery of virtualization, Chris balances intricate system design with a passion for long-term sustainability, both digital and earthly. Where others see wires and workloads, he sees ecosystems and possibilities.


**Skills:**

- Veteran of enterprise infrastructure and large-scale system strategy

- Expert in virtualization, architecture design, and scaling with intent

- Combines technical expertise with mentorship and long-term foresight


**Hobbies:**

Off the clock, Chris shifts seamlessly from system orchestration to real-world symphonies—still performing live music with the same fire he brings to tech. He gardens with purpose, guided by permaculture principles and a vision for self-sustaining ecosystems. He’s deeply involved in developing sustainable buildings and technologies, plays chess daily with a tactician’s mindset, and reads like knowledge is fuel (because for him, it is).


**Favorite Music:**

Pink Floyd – classic, thoughtful, and endlessly replayable.

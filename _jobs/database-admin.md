## About Us

We're a lean, high-performance IT consultancy specializing in medical and dental practice technology. Our team values technical competence, professional integrity, and efficient service delivery. We work with premium clients who expect expert-level service.


## The Role

We need a SQL Database Administrator who can handle production database environments for healthcare practices. This is real DBA work with real consequences - when systems go down, patient care is affected.

### Primary Responsibilities:

- MySQL administration (primary focus) - performance tuning, optimization, maintenance
- MS SQL Server administration - regular maintenance, backup management, performance monitoring
- Proactive monitoring with Zabbix - configure alerts and actively monitor database health
- Query optimization - troubleshoot slow-running or problematic queries
- Transaction troubleshooting - resolve deadlocks, hung transactions, and locking issues
- Backup and disaster recovery - design, implement, and test backup strategies
- Internal team collaboration - work with technical staff to resolve database issues efficiently


### What We're Looking For:

**Technical Requirements:**

- 3+ years hands-on SQL administration experience
- Strong understanding of storage engines (InnoDB vs MyISAM)
- Query optimization and troubleshooting slow/problematic queries
- Deadlock resolution and transaction management
- Backup/restore strategy implementation
- Experience with Zabbix monitoring and alerting
- Database performance monitoring and troubleshooting

**Character Requirements:**

- Honesty - if you don't know something, say so
- Growth mindset - embrace continuous learning and professional development
- Efficiency - work effectively to support client services without direct client interaction
- Proactive mindset - monitoring alerts, not user complaints, should tell you about problems
- Clear communication - explain technical issues effectively to internal team members
- Team collaboration - we work hard, celebrate wins, and support each other's success

**Important Notes:**

This is a collaborative team environment. Your work will have direct impact on client outcomes and business success. We value transparency in our project management and believe in clear accountability for results.

We value competence over credentials. We'll test your actual knowledge, not just accept certifications or job titles. We may ask about technologies that don't exist to see how you handle unknown information.

Quality matters. Your work efficiency and technical expertise directly impact client relationships and project success. We support team members who deliver professional results.


### What We Offer:

- Remote work with flexible scheduling
- Continuous professional development - 10% of your time (4 hours/week) is dedicated to ongoing training in technical skills, communication, and interpersonal development
- Superstar team culture - we train like champions and celebrate both personal and professional victories
- Growth opportunity in a company that values technical excellence
- Meaningful work supporting healthcare technology infrastructure
- Supportive environment with humor, collaboration, and genuine investment in your success


**To Apply:**

Send your resume to [lai@mastiffsystems.com](mailto:lai@mastiffsystems.com) with a brief note explaining:

1. Your specific MySQL administration experience
2. How you approach database monitoring (proactive vs reactive)
3. A time you had to admit you didn't know something technical


We're looking for someone who wants real responsibility and the compensation that comes with delivering professional results.

Equal opportunity employer. We welcome candidates who share our values of technical competence, professional integrity, and client service excellence.

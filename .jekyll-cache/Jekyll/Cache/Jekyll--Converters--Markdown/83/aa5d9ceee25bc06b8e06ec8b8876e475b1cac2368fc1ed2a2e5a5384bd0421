I"ö<p>Not all heroes wield swordsâ€”some carry SSH keys and boot into the unknown. Fitzkenâ€™s journey began in the humming halls of virtual machines and firewalls, where he forged a Proxmox hypervisor cluster spanning five mighty nodes. From configuring backups through NFS channels to migrating entire fleets of servers, heâ€™s earned a reputation for keeping systems running when others falter. Heâ€™s worked with hosting giants like Bluehost and OVH, steering infrastructure through outages and upgrades with calm, clockwork precision.</p>

    <p>Fluent in the language of Linux, from cryptic logs to silent daemons</p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>Adept at building, monitoring, and maintaining infrastructure with a craftsmanâ€™s eye</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hobbies:</strong></p>

<p>When the servers sleep, Fitzken turns to gentler pursuits: baking loaves that rise like clean bootups, experimenting with new recipes, building curious DIY contraptions, and spending quiet hours with his loyal dogs.</p>

<p><strong>Favorite Music:</strong></p>

<p>Whether deep in the command line or waiting for a kernel patch to land, Fitzken queues up Chappell Roan, Billie Eilish, and pulse-pounding EDMâ€”fuel for the modern mechanistâ€™s mind.</p>

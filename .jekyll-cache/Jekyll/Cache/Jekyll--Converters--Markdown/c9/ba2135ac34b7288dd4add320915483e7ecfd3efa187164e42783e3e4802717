I"=<p>In a world of brass and bloom, where sketches spark life and gears hum beneath brushstrokes, stands Gabriel “Inkgear” Vicente. Trained on both canvas and console, he’s lent his vision to brands like SunnyBee LLC, while shaping worlds independently through illustration, 3D rendering, animation, and interior design. With every stroke—digital or dimensional—Gabriel blurs the line between design and storytelling.</p>

<p>Whether freelancing on the frontier or crafting with a team, he sees design as more than aesthetics—it’s atmosphere, emotion, and meaning. From precise vector linework to ambient 3D compositions, he crafts visuals that feel lived in, yet timeless.</p>

  <li>Brings environments to life through 3D rendering and animation</li>
  <li>Designs interiors and visuals with structure, elegance, and mood in mind</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hobbies:</strong>
Gabriel winds down with the worlds he doesn’t have to build—diving into video games for both play and inspiration, and losing himself in music’s textures and tones. His visual instincts are shaped as much by sound as by sight.</p>

<p><strong>Favorite Artists:</strong>
<em>Stephen Sanchez</em> and <em>Avi Kaplan</em> — haunting, melodic, and grounded. Voices that echo the kind of depth Gabriel weaves into his designs.</p>

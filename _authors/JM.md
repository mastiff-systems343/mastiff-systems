Long before the playbook was written on modern IT operations, John Michael was already running the plays, moving seamlessly between support, systems, and databases with the kind of adaptability that separates good technicians from great operators. From troubleshooting critical incidents in the engine room of IT Support to architecting database solutions and managing the clockwork precision of complex system environments, John Michael has built a career on being ready for anything, seeing the details others miss, and finding solutions where others see dead ends.

Known for a sharp eye and an even sharper instinct for problem-solving, John Michael brings resourcefulness to every challenge, whether it's fine-tuning the gears of a database query, stabilizing a fragile system with the care of a master engineer, or pulling a team through a high-pressure incident like a captain navigating stormy skies. Where others see obstacles, John Michael sees opportunities to adapt, recalibrate, and deliver.


**Skills:**

- Veteran navigator across IT support, database administration, and system management
- Detail-oriented approach to diagnostics, troubleshooting, and precision optimization
- Adaptable under pressure with a resourceful, brass-and-bolts mindset


**Hobbies:**

When the tickets are closed and the servers are humming like well-oiled machinery, John Michael trades keyboard commands for court plays—staying sharp on the basketball court with the same competitive edge brought to production environments. Photography captures the world through a different aperture, while outdoor pursuits keep the balance between screen time and real time intact—proving that even the best technicians need to step outside the workshop.


**Favorite Music:**

Linkin Park, Bon Jovi, Bamboo Mañalac, Kamikazee – raw energy, honest lyrics, and anthems that fuel both focus and freedom.

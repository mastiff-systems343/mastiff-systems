You’ve made a simple Notion dashboard and are now looking to take it to the next level? Here are a few cool tips to make your dashboard work for you instead of you working on them.


Relate Multiple Data Sets

If you have two databases that are related, you can connect them using the relation property so you don’t have to manually update each database separately. This feature is particularly useful for linking projects with tasks, clients with projects, or employees with their assignments. This way, you can easily view and manage related information in one place without duplicating data.


Routine Actions in One Click

With the button feature, you can automate routine actions, such as creating a new page, inserting blocks, or editing pages, all with a single click. Buttons are highly customizable, allowing you to tailor their functionality to suit specific needs or workflows.

Let’s try creating a button to add a page to a database in one click.


Automate Updates

Here’s another automation trick for databases: Triggers. Triggers reduce the need for manual updates and help keep your data consistent and up to date. For example, if you update an entry, you can set up an automation to automatically notify a group of people, eliminating the need to manually inform them.


Note:  I am doing this from my private space since this is just a demo but you have to do this in a teamspace in order for this to work.

Create Templates

Take advantage of templates. If you have a database where you frequently add similar pages, like client profiles, duplicating a page can require extra effort to remove existing client information. Instead, you can create a template with the same format, allowing you to quickly generate new client profiles without the extra cleanup. This saves time and keeps your workflow efficient.


Notion Formulas

Are you a fan of Excel? Then you might want to explore Notion’s formulas. Notion formulas allow you to create dynamic, calculated fields within databases, enabling powerful features like calculations, conditional formatting, and logical operations. For example, you can easily track your monthly expenses using a simple formula.


These small changes will definitely transform your work dashboard. Give them a try and see how they can improve your Notion experience!

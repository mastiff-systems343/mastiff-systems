Not all heroes wield swords—some carry SSH keys and boot into the unknown. Fitzken’s journey began in the humming halls of virtual machines and firewalls, where he forged a Proxmox hypervisor cluster spanning five mighty nodes. From configuring backups through NFS channels to migrating entire fleets of servers, he’s earned a reputation for keeping systems running when others falter. He’s worked with hosting giants like Bluehost and OVH, steering infrastructure through outages and upgrades with calm, clockwork precision.


**Skills:**

- Fluent in the language of Linux, from cryptic logs to silent daemons

- Virtualization expert with a knack for scalable, high-availability systems

- Adept at building, monitoring, and maintaining infrastructure with a craftsman’s eye


**Hobbies:**

When the servers sleep, Fitzken turns to gentler pursuits: baking loaves that rise like clean bootups, experimenting with new recipes, building curious DIY contraptions, and spending quiet hours with his loyal dogs.


**Favorite Music:**

Whether deep in the command line or waiting for a kernel patch to land, Fitzken queues up Chappell Roan, Billie Eilish, and pulse-pounding EDM—fuel for the modern mechanist’s mind.

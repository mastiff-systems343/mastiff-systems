I"\<p>As of late I have been thinking a lot about just how bad the internet has gotten. Google search is almost useless as it’s full of ads and not real links for page after page. Content farms and bots have made actual human content hard to find. Social media is just a giant manipulative echo chamber and it’s all done in the name of business and extracting every last penny from the user of the site. If you haven’t heard of the dead internet theory you should read up on it. I don’t know that I fully subscribe to the entire premise which is, that the internet is made by robots not humans but it sure seems like at least some of the internet is dead and that all this content is generated for the advertisers’ benefit. With AI in the mix it certainly seems so and even my local news webpage is so full of ads that it almost seems not credible.</p>

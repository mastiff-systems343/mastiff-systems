I"·<p>Monitoring power consumption is essential for making smarter decisions, reducing costs, and promoting sustainability‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre managing a data center, a smart home, or a renewable energy project. A power monitoring virtual machine (VM) simplifies this process by offering a centralized platform to collect, analyze, and visualize energy data.</p>

<p>In this blog, we‚Äôll walk you through setting up a power monitoring VM, covering essential tools, software, and configurations to streamline your energy management. Let‚Äôs get started and optimize your setup!</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Virtual Machine Host
  You‚Äôll need either VMware ESXi or Proxmox Virtual Environment installed on your server.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)
  Your UPS should have either a USB or Ethernet port for communication.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Virtual Machine Image
  Typically downloadable from the manufacturer‚Äôs website, usually in .VMDK format.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>System Overview</strong></p>

</div>

<p>In this example setup:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We have a physical server connected to the UPS using both power and data via USB.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A hypervisor (ESXi or Proxmox) is already installed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We‚Äôll use the manufacturer‚Äôs utility image to deploy the power monitoring VM.</p>

    <p>‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The monitoring system used in this guide supports VMware ESXi only.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

I"<p>Welcome back to Mastiff Systems’ Cybersecurity Essentials series. Last week’s topic covered malware and security updates, highlighting some of the most common cyber threats and how regular security updates can help keep your systems safe from the latest threats.</p>

<p>This week, we will demystify “network” and explore network security — how to safeguard your office Wi-Fi, devices, and internet connections from attacks that target the systems where your data flows.</p>

<h4 id="why-you-should-care">Why You Should Care</h4>

<p>Cybercriminals target smaller businesses because they often lack in-house security teams or dedicated IT personnel.</p>

<p>Your network is the backbone of your digital operations — it’s how devices communicate and where data flows internally. Many small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) rely on remote access tools, cloud services, email platforms, file storage solutions, and online third-party applications — all of which depend on the network to function.</p>

<p>Misconfigured or poorly secured networks create easy entry points for cybercriminals. If the network is compromised, the consequences can be severe: <strong>data theft, account breaches, loss of client trust, reputational damage, regulatory penalties</strong>, or even a complete shutdown of operations.</p>

<p>If you’re curious about the scale of these threats, here are links to public databases that track real-world breach incidents in the USA. There are around five new breaches reported every day, affecting businesses of all sizes:</p>

<h4 id="real-world-examples">Real-World Examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Target breach (2013)</strong><br />
Attackers got in through an HVAC contractor’s remote network access, compromising <strong>70 million credit and debit card accounts</strong>. This highlights how even third-party connections can pose risk. SMBs are targeted not just for their own data, but as stepping stones to their larger clients.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Capital One Breach (2019)</strong><br />
Through a misconfigured web application firewall, a former Amazon employee was able to access private customer data stored in the cloud. About <strong>100 million records</strong> were exposed, costing Capital One <strong>$80 million</strong> in settlements to companies and individuals.</p>

<h4 id="how-network-works">How Network Works</h4>

<p>In IT, a <strong>network</strong> refers to a system of interconnected devices that communicate and share data with each other and to the internet. Your office network is made up of a few main components — here’s what each part does and why it matters:</p>

<p><strong>Router – Gateway to the Internet</strong>
The router is the main device that connects your office to the internet. It also creates your Wi-Fi network, allowing wireless devices to go online.<br />
If the router is poorly secured (e.g. default passwords, outdated firmware), attackers can use it to monitor or hijack traffic to steal credentials or data.</p>

<p><strong>Devices – Computers, Phones, Tablets, VOIP, Cameras</strong>
These are the machines your team uses daily to get work done. Each one connects to your network and accesses the internet, cloud apps, and shared files.<br />
If one device is infected or compromised, it can be used to attack others on the same network.</p>

<p><strong>Firewall – Your Traffic Filter</strong>
The firewall controls what traffic is allowed in and out of your network. It blocks suspicious or unauthorized connections from reaching your devices.<br />
It can be built into your router or set up as separate devices. Proper firewall rules can help prevent <strong>malware, ransomware</strong>, and <strong>data theft</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Local Server – Where Files and Software Are Hosted</strong>
Many dental and law offices use a local server to store files, manage business software, or run internal applications.<br />
This could be a file server, a practice management system (like Dentrix or Open Dental), or a legal case management server (like Clio or Time Matters). These often hold <strong>sensitive data</strong> like client records, billing info, and confidential documents.</p>

<p><strong>VPN – Secure Remote Access</strong> 
A <strong>VPN (Virtual Private Network)</strong> creates a secure tunnel for remote staff to access your network. It encrypts data so that outsiders (like hackers or ISPs) can’t see what’s being sent.<br />
Without a VPN, tools like Remote Desktop can be dangerous if exposed directly to the internet.</p>

<h4 id="simple-ways-to-safeguard-your-network">Simple Ways to Safeguard Your Network</h4>

<p>Here’s how to secure your business network without needing to be an IT expert:</p>

<p><strong>Secure Your Router</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Change the default Wi-Fi name (SSID) and admin password</li>
  <li>Use WPA3 or at least WPA2 encryption</li>
  <li>Turn off remote management unless absolutely necessary</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Use a Strong Firewall</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure your router’s built-in firewall is enabled</li>
  <li>Consider a dedicated hardware firewall for added protection</li>
  <li>Block suspicious websites and malicious ads</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Segment Your Network</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a guest Wi-Fi for visitors and non-critical devices</li>
  <li>Keep it separate from your office systems (computers, servers, printers)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Keep Everything Updated</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Routinely update your router, computers, and smart devices</li>
  <li>Patching vulnerabilities helps stop known exploits</li>
  <li>One outdated device can put the entire network at risk</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Safe Remote Access</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Use VPN for remote work</li>
  <li>Avoid exposing Remote Desktop without extra protections like 2FA</li>
  <li>Immediately revoke access for former employees</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Practice Safe Digital Habits</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Back up files regularly to an external drive or secure cloud</li>
  <li>Be cautious with email attachments and untrusted downloads</li>
  <li>Use antivirus or endpoint protection to catch threats early</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h4>

<p>Network security might feel technical, but it boils down to intentional care and consistent maintenance.</p>

<p>Most attacks aren’t sophisticated — they exploit unpatched systems, default settings, or forgotten devices. Even a single misconfigured router or compromised phone can create a backdoor into your business.</p>

<p>Take the time to implement these basic steps, and consider professional help to build a strong and resilient digital foundation for your company.</p>

<p>Next Week, we’ll dive into another critical layer of defense: Passwords, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and Account Security.</p>

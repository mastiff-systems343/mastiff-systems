<p>This is one reason Apple gets a reputation for being more â€œexpensiveâ€ but you
canâ€™t tell me those are the same cables. You really do get what you pay for here in
both speed and longer term reliability. Jobâ€™s famously said â€œApple doesnâ€™t know
how to make junkâ€ and despite a few missteps here and there, this seems true.
When it comes to technology the devils in the details and Apple does detail better
than anyone.
Iâ€™m sure they have good margin on these, of course. But itâ€™s not the highway
robbery people think it is.</p>

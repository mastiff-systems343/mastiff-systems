Welcome back to Mastiff Systems’ **Cybersecurity Essentials** series. In our last article, we talked about ransomware and how backups can be a lifesaver. Today, we’re focusing on something even more basic but just as critical — keeping your software updated and understanding how malware actually works.

#### Why You Should Care

Every piece of software from your clinic’s practice management system to your office printer firmware has potential security flaws. Cybercriminals look for these “holes” to sneak malware into your system.

When you ignore update prompts, you're essentially leaving the digital doors to your business unlocked. The risks are serious:

- Patient, client, or financial data could be stolen  
- Malicious software could spy on your activity, corrupt critical files, or capture your passwords  
- Outdated systems are one of the most common entry points for ransomware  
- You may even unknowingly violate important compliance regulations such as **HIPAA** or the **FTC Safeguards Rule**

If you're curious about the scale of these threats, here are links to public databases that track real-world breach incidents in the USA. There are around five new breaches reported every day, affecting businesses of all sizes:

- [Medical Data Breaches (U.S.): HHS OCR Breach Portal](https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf)  
- [General Data Breaches (All Industries): Privacy Rights Clearinghouse](https://privacyrights.org/data-breaches)  
- [California-Specific Breach Notices: California Attorney General Breach List](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/databreach/list)


#### Real-World Examples

- **Equifax (2017)** - *Software Vulnerability*: Hackers stole personal data of 147 million Americans because a known vulnerability in Apache Struts wasn’t patched even though a fix had been released 2 months earlier. Settlement of around $700 million in fines and damages.

- **WannaCry Outbreak (2017)** - *Ransomware*: A global ransomware attack affected over 200,000 computers in 150+ countries including the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), disrupting surgeries and emergency services. The patch had already been available for an exploit in Windows XP, but many systems hadn’t installed it. Costed $13 million for cancelled appointments and operation and $100 million for IT and data recovery.

- **GameOver ZeuS (2012)** - *Trojan*: A banking trojan that infected over 1 million computers, mostly through phishing emails. It stole online banking credentials by monitoring keystrokes and screen activity, allowing attackers to quietly drain victims' accounts. The malware was designed to evade antivirus detection and spread across networks. By the time the FBI took it down in 2014, it had caused over $100 million in losses.

#### How Malware Works

“Malware” stands for *malicious software* — it's a general term for any program designed to harm or exploit your devices and data. Last week, we covered one specific type of malware called ransomware.

Here are common types of malware:

- **Viruses**: Attach to files and spread between devices  
- **Trojans**: Disguised as legitimate software to trick you into installing them  
- **Spyware**: Secretly monitors what you do like a hidden camera on your system  
- **Keyloggers**: Record your keystrokes to steal passwords and sensitive info  
- **Adware**: Bombards you with ads (sometimes part of more dangerous malware)  
- **Ransomware**: Locks your files until you pay up (covered in Article 3)  

Most malware enters your system because of:

- Clicking malicious links or attachments  
- Using outdated software or app  
- Downloading from untrusted sources  
- Poor firewall or antivirus protection  

Once malware has infected a system, it can do serious damage behind the scenes. It may steal sensitive files, passwords, and client data. Some malware can spy on your screen activity, hijack your webcam or microphone, or give attackers remote access to your entire network. Others may silently encrypt or corrupt data, disable security tools, or spread to other connected devices.

**The worst part?** Many malware infections go unnoticed until real damage is done, making prevention and early detection absolutely critical.


#### Why Software Updates Matter

Vendors like Microsoft, Apple, and even printer manufacturers release updates to improve **security**, **stability**, and **performance**.

- **Security patches** fix known vulnerabilities before hackers can exploit them  
- **Bug fixes** prevent crashes and data loss  
- **Performance updates** help your systems run more efficiently  

Delaying updates leaves your systems exposed to known threats. Many ransomware and malware attacks succeed because businesses failed to apply available fixes. Updating regularly is one of the easiest and most effective ways to protect your business.

#### What You Can Do To Prevent Malware

1. **Turn on automatic updates**  
   Enable automatic updates for all your systems like Windows, macOS, web browsers, antivirus software, and mobile apps. This ensures you receive critical security patches as soon as they’re released, even if you forget.

2. **Remove outdated or unused software**  
   Applications you no longer use can still be exploited by attackers. Uninstall any unnecessary programs to reduce your attack surface.

3. **Update office equipment, too**  
   Devices like printers, routers, firewalls, and VoIP phones often run outdated firmware and can be overlooked. Check with your vendor or have your IT provider review and apply the latest firmware updates.

4. **Use Antivirus**  
   Antivirus software plays an important role, but it can’t protect you if malware enters through outdated or unpatched software. Staying current with updates is your first and best line of defense.

5. **Monitor network using a firewall**  
   Enable a firewall on your devices and network to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic, preventing unauthorized access and malware spread.

6. **Practice safe online behavior & Train employees**  
   Be cautious with email links and attachments from unknown senders. Avoid downloading files from untrusted websites or peer-to-peer platforms. Stick to reputable websites when browsing online. Don’t click on pop-ups, especially those asking you to download something.


#### Final Thoughts

Malware infections don’t always start with a dramatic hack — sometimes, all it takes is a missed update or an old app you forgot to uninstall.

Keeping your software and systems up to date is one of the **simplest**, most **effective** ways to protect your business from cyber threats. It reduces your risk of ransomware, data breaches, and compliance violations without requiring expensive tools or advanced IT skills.

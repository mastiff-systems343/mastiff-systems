From the wind-swept ports of the Gulf Trade Lines to the great engine halls of international firms, Norris “Ironwake” Vargas has spent over a decade mastering the art of infrastructure. He’s not just a technician—he’s a multilingual engineer of systems, fluent in the languages of VMware, Hyper-V, Proxmox, and the delicate pulse of cloud architecture.


His work spans continents and cultures—trusted by crews hailing from the Middle East, Australia, Europe, and Asia. Whether tending to on-prem servers or navigating the cloud strata of Azure and Google Workspace, Norris ensures no cog slips, no signal drops, and no packet is left behind.


**Skills:**

- Mastery of hardware/software harmony across countless operating systems

- Troubleshooting virtuoso—he can trace a misconfiguration like smoke through pipes

- Commanding knowledge of virtualization and cloud environments

- Operates with a watchmaker’s precision—nothing escapes his diagnostic gaze


**Hobbies:**

In rare moments of rest, Norris unwinds with a classic reel or a thoughtful documentary. He still plays top-shelf triple-A games, studying their design like one might study blueprints. In his workshop, he tinkers with towers, servers, and switches just for fun—because when you love the craft, the craft never stops. He also enjoys connecting with fellow guild members across the aether through social channels and shared sparks of curiosity.


**Favorite Music:**

A fan of easy listening and smooth background harmonies, Norris prefers his soundtracks as polished as his server logs—steady, calming, and always in tune with the task at hand.

# How to Send Password Securely using [Mastiff Password Pusher](https://pw.mastiffsystems.com/)

Sending passwords over email or text may seem easy, but it leaves a permanent record that could be exposed if those messages are ever compromised. With Password Pusher, we avoid that risk by creating secure, one-time links that automatically expire after use. This way, sensitive information isn’t left sitting in inboxes or chat histories. To send your username and password securely, just follow these steps: 

1. Send us the username via email or text.
2. Enter the password you want to share into the password field.
3. Set expiration options:
    - Expire after 1 day
    - Limit to 1 view
4. Enable additional security settings by checking:
    - ✅ "Use a 1-click retrieval step"
    - ✅ "Allow immediate deletion"
5. Add a passphrase to protect the download link (remember and copy this passphrase).
6. Click "Push It" to generate the secure link.
7. Copy the link or QR code and share it with the us.
8. Send the passphrase and the link separately using different communication methods.
    - Example: Send the passphrase via text message and the link via email.

**Sending Multiple Passwords**

When sharing more than one credential, create **a separate Password Pusher link for each password**. This ensures that if one link is compromised, only that single account is affected.

**Steps:**
  1. For each password, create a new Password Pusher entry using the same security settings:
    - Expire after 1 day
    - Limit to 1 view
    - Enable: ✅ 1-click retrieval step and ✅ Allow immediate deletion
    - Add a unique passphrase for each link
2. Send the usernames via text in the following format (one per message to avoid confusion):
    - username1: (username)
    - username2: (username)
3. Send the secure links via email. To keep them clearly matched to the right usernames, use the following subject format:
    - Subject: username1 link
    - Subject: username2 link
4. Send the passphrases separately via text, one per message, using the format:
    - passphrase1: (passphrase)
    - passphrase2: (passphrase)

**Example Flow:**
  - Text 1 → username1: admin01
  - Text 2 → username2: staff02
  - Text 3 → passphrase1: apple-92-giraffe
  - Text 4 → passphrase2: river-33-gorgeous
  - Email 1 → Subject: username1 link (contains link for admin01’s password)
  - Email 2 → Subject: username2 link (contains link for staff02’s password)

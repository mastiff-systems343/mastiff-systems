I"¯<p>Welcome back!
This article is part of Mastiff Systemsâ€™ ongoing Cybersecurity Essentials series, written specifically for small to medium-sized business owners and non-technical teams. Last weekâ€™s topic covered phishing and email security, one of the most common entry points for cyberattacks.</p>

<p>Today, weâ€™re focusing on ransomware, a fast-growing threat that can lock your files, freeze your operations, and demand a hefty payment to get access back.</p>

<h4 id="why-you-should-care">Why You Should Care</h4>

<p>Ransomware doesnâ€™t just affect large corporations. Itâ€™s increasingly hitting smaller organizations like dental clinics, law firms, and local service providers. These businesses are often more vulnerable because they donâ€™t have advanced IT defenses, yet they store valuable data like patient records, legal documents, or financial files that attackers know youâ€™ll pay to get back.</p>

<p>A ransomware attack can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lock you out of your own systems and files</li>
  <li>Force you to halt operations</li>
  <li>Damage client trust and your reputation</li>
  <li>Cost millions in ransom and even more in recovery</li>
</ul>

<p>If youâ€™re curious about the scale of these threats, here are links to public databases that track real-world breach incidents in the USA. There are around five new breaches reported every day, affecting businesses of all sizes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Medical Data Breaches (U.S.): <a href="https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf">HHS OCR Breach Portal</a></li>
  <li>General Data Breaches (All Industries): <a href="https://privacyrights.org/data-breaches">Privacy Rights Clearinghouse</a></li>
  <li>California-Specific Breach Notices: <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/databreach/list">California Attorney General Breach List</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Real-World Examples</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/healthtechsecurity/news/366594571/Dental-Care-Alliance-Reaches-3M-Proposed-Settlement-Over-Healthcare-Cyberattack">Dental Care Alliance (2020)</a></strong>
A ransomware attack on DSO Dental Care Alliance affected over 1 million patients. Hackers stole and encrypted sensitive patient data, leading to compliance issues and patient notifications under HIPAA, and agreed to a <strong>$3million</strong> settlement.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/ransomware-attack-on-law-firm-leads-to-data-breach/">Campbell Conroy &amp; Oâ€™Neil (2021)</a></strong>
A high-profile law firm was targeted. Ransomware locked up systems and compromised data from major corporate clients including Boeing, Pfizer, and ExxonMobil.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/us/baltimore-ransomware.html">City of Baltimore (2019)</a></strong>
A ransomware attack shut down most city systems including payments and email for weeks. The city refused to pay the <strong>$76,000</strong> ransom but ended up spending over $18 million in recovery.</p>

<h4 id="how-ransomware-works">How Ransomware Works</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Infection 
    A ransomware attack often starts when someone clicks a malicious link or downloads an infected attachment usually from a phishing email, compromised website or unpatched software with vulnerabilities.</li>
  <li>Encryption
    Once inside your system, the malware locks (encrypts) files so you canâ€™t access them. Youâ€™ll often see a pop-up message demanding a ransom, usually in cryptocurrency, in exchange for the decryption key.</li>
  <li>Extortion
    Some ransomware groups now steal your data before encrypting it. If you donâ€™t pay, they threaten to leak it online putting client confidentiality and regulatory compliance at risk.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="what-you-can-do-to-prevent-it">What You Can Do to Prevent It</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Keep Backups And Test Them
    - Make regular, automatic backups of your critical data.
    - Use the 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies of your data, on 2 different types of media, with 1 stored off-site or in the cloud.
    - Test your backups regularly. If you canâ€™t restore, itâ€™s not a real backup.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Train Staff on Phishing Awareness
    Most ransomware infections come from email. Training your team to recognize phishing attempts is your first line of defense (see our second article for tips).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Patch Your Systems
    Ransomware often exploits known software vulnerabilities. Always keep your operating systems, browsers, and applications up to date.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Limit User Permissions
    Give employees access only to the files and systems they need. If ransomware infects a low-permission account, the damage is more contained.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use Antivirus and Endpoint Protection
    Modern antivirus software can block ransomware before it executes. Many systems now use AI to detect suspicious behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Segment Your Network
    Donâ€™t let one infected machine bring down your whole office. Separating devices and networks (e.g., admin vs. guest Wi-Fi) helps contain threats.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="what-to-do-after-a-ransomware-attack">What to Do After a Ransomware Attack</h4>

<p>Even with precautions in place, no system is 100% immune. If youâ€™re hit by ransomware, follow these steps immediately:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Disconnect Affected Systems
    Unplug or disconnect infected computers from the network to prevent the ransomware from spreading.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contact Your IT Provider or Incident Response Team
    If you have an IT team or have another IT partner, notify them right away. Donâ€™t try to handle it alone unless you have in-house expertise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Donâ€™t Pay the Ransomâ€¦Yet
    Paying the ransom doesnâ€™t guarantee your data will be restored and may encourage future attacks. Exhaust all recovery options first. Consult legal and cybersecurity professionals before deciding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check Backups
    Verify the integrity of your most recent backup and restore from a clean point before the infection. This is often the quickest and safest way to recover.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Report the Attack
    - Notify the appropriate authorities:
Report incidents to the FBIâ€™s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at ic3.gov or the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) at myservices.cisa.gov/irf
    - Healthcare providers: If Protected Health Information (PHI) is involved, report the breach to the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) â€“ Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at hhs.gov/hipaa.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You may also need to notify clients or regulators, especially if sensitive data was exposed (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.).</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Change All Passwords
    Assume passwords were compromised. Reset all system and email credentials, and enable MFA wherever possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conduct a Postmortem
    Understand how the attack happened and fix the gaps. Update security tools, conduct new training, and review your recovery plan.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Final Thoughts</p>

<p>Ransomware is one of the most damaging cyber threats today. It encrypts your data, making it completely inaccessible until a ransom is paid (and even then, recovery isnâ€™t guaranteed). But with strong backups, updated systems, and a well-prepared team, you can dramatically reduce your risk. And if the worst happens, knowing how to respond can make all the difference.</p>

I"œ<p>Not all heroes wield swordsâ€”some carry SSH keys and boot into the unknown. Fitzkenâ€™s journey began in the humming halls of virtual machines and firewalls, where he forged a Proxmox hypervisor cluster spanning five mighty nodes. From configuring backups through NFS channels to migrating entire fleets of servers, heâ€™s earned a reputation for keeping systems running when others falter. Heâ€™s worked with hosting giants like Bluehost and OVH, steering infrastructure through outages and upgrades with calm, clockwork precision.</p>

<p>Off the clock, Chris shifts seamlessly from system orchestration to real-world symphoniesâ€”still performing live music with the same fire he brings to tech. He gardens with purpose, guided by permaculture principles and a vision for self-sustaining ecosystems. Heâ€™s deeply involved in developing sustainable buildings and technologies, plays chess daily with a tacticianâ€™s mindset, and reads like knowledge is fuel (because for him, it is).</p>

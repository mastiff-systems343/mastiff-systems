I"#<p>For over 23 years, Tim has shaped the silent engines of the digital world: data. From early schematics to modern warehousing, he’s mapped the flow of information like a cartographer of code—refining, tuning, and optimizing until every query sings. Specializing in reporting, ETL, and data warehouse architecture, Tim is a Microsoft-certified professional in Transact-SQL and Power BI, with Python and PowerShell always within reach of his toolkit.</p>

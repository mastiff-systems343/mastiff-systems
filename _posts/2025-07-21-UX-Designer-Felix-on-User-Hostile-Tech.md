excerpt: Felix's influential essays "The Small Web" and "Against a User-Hostile Web" have inspired a growing movement of developers and designers seeking alternatives to big tech's surveillance capitalism. In this interview, he discusses how the original spirit of sharing and connection has been corrupted by engagement-driven algorithms that profit from division and manipulation. Felix also shares his work with OpenProject, his vision for an artisanal web made by people for people, and why he believes digital sovereignty is crucial for Europe's future.

Felix is a UX designer at OpenProject, an open-source project management tool, and the person who wrote about "user-hostile" design and small web essays that inspired Mastiff to craft its own website from hand. In this conversation, we explore his perspective on surveillance capitalism and platform manipulation, how open-source companies balance profitability with ethics, and why he believes we need better tech literacy to hold big platforms accountable. Felix also shares practical advice for anyone wanting to create their own corner of the web, free from algorithms and SEO optimization.

From digital sovereignty in Europe to the joy of building websites that break all the UX rules, Felix offers a thoughtful take on technology that puts people before metrics.

#### GET TO KNOW FELIX

**So obviously you're a musician, a designer, and a programmer. To kick things off, can you give us the 10,000-foot view — who are you, and what do you do?**

I would say I'm someone who's interested in technology, in engineering or math. I'm very much that. I don't really go into the depths of understanding things academically. That's never been my forte, but I've always liked creating interesting things. I work as a UX designer, but that's a small part of who I am. I enjoy that work, but I would say I just like creating things, and the process of enjoying creating things, and the fact that all the things I do are not necessarily my job means that I can have a lot of freedom in doing that. It also means I don't actually do very much of it because I'm so slow at producing. I do one song a year, one article every two or three years. So my rate of production, if this were my job, it would be catastrophic. But I'm interested in technology and the arts, I would say.

**Can you tell us what UX design is?**

UX design is something similar to the equivalent of architecture, but for software. It's not only that, it's evolved into something that adds a lot more. There's ergonomics, usability. Essentially, software design had a history of engineer-driven design. So programmers get together and say, well, these are the functions we need, and then you put it on a screen. This is very high level and sort of very old, but it's important to go to Genesis. And UX was the notion that what if we spend some time with the users who will end up using our products and try to get a better sense of what we should actually do to help them?

I'll give you two very small examples perhaps people can relate to. The first one is not my example, it's Don Norman's example: you've walked through doors, right? Everybody has walked through doors. I remember back, I used to work in a communication agency, and it was a really nice new building. If you're in an open office, I would have my laptop, I would have sometimes a coffee, and I'm trying to juggle that, and I'd find a door in front of me. And on both sides, you'd have a handle. And so some of the doors you push, some of the doors you pull. And it was very tough to figure out what it was until you actually did it.

But if one side were to be flat and the other side had a handle, you wouldn't even really need to tell the user to push or pull. The user would immediately understand what they would need to do. The shape of the object would explain how it's used. And so UX is trying to do that, but with software.

**What are some of the tools you use in UX design?**

There are multiple disciplines. When I started, there weren't all these disciplines, but now there are. For example, there is user research. This could be ethnographic research. Before you even start with any code, any mock ups, or any design as in visual design, you spend time with the users and try to understand.

In my previous agency, we worked with customers installing gas canisters in people's houses. No matter how good a designer you are, you don't know what they're thinking or what the challenges are, it's just a domain you don't know. Or if you're working with a company trying to help people quit smoking, you need to send ethnographers or anthropologists, depending on the kind of research, to understand. Users won't really tell you. You need to go in and see what the real problems are.

There can be prototyping with different stakeholders. The needs are different between the user, the people paying, and the people building. You try to find a compromise.

Then there's testing. Once you have a prototype, you test it with users to see if they understand it, if they appreciate it, if they can do what you want them to do or what they want to do. And of course, there's the visual design.

**What was the first computer that you ever got?**

I don't remember very clearly if it was Windows 3.1 or if it was 95. I think it was 3.1, but I was very young. But the one I really remember using was Windows 95, and then DOS, of course. All the games were launched via DOS.

**What do you think your favorite computer is?**

Let's exclude the modern world. As hardware, a friend of my father's gave us a ThinkPad, one of the original ThinkPads. I used to do basic 3D modeling on a ThinkPad whilst I was going to relatives' houses and perhaps not engaging in conversations with relatives, but it was more interesting to me at the time. So as hardware, that was definitely my favorite. They also weighed like tanks.

But the OS that I really liked, before I switched to Mac (I switched when I was maybe 15 or so), was the Windows NT variety of Windows 2000. It didn't have a lot of animation. The UI was very old-school Windows, but I thought it was clean. It was super fast and very stable. Not very exciting reasons, but I really liked it.

**What were you using to model back then? What software were you working with?**

Bryce 3D.

#### USER-HOSTILE

**You coined this term in one of your articles, and I've loved it. I've heard other people talk about it, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on the user-hostile web. What would you say user-hostile is?**

The start of all this is a rather naive thought, but then it goes into something that's a bit more interesting. The naive thought is to say, the history of the web and also the internet with other protocols was essentially to get people together and to share things. It had background in the academic world and, of course, in the military world. And then, initially, it was share thoughts. Then you had usernets. Also, let's share ideas. There's this basic notion that it allows a level of communication and what I like to call cross-planetary communication that was not possible, neither at that rate nor at that scale with that many people. So in so many ways, it was quite insane what it afforded.

That was something that naively because it wasn't all roses was something that allowed us to connect and share thoughts and ideas in a way that was not possible. So it enabled humanity to do something. And over time, of course, we created new protocols, we created email. Of course, the web itself came in in '92, and then you had a lot of other services came in, right?

And with the dot-com boom in the 2000s, that's when we started the business aspect of it, because there was so much money involved, and there was so much money injected into the system. That caused a change, and there's this notion of: how do we get the most number of users, and how do we make it initially not even profitable, it was just market share because there was just so much money. And that corrupts the system a little bit, because then the incentives started changing.

And then it became, how can we own more of the market? That's a shift in thinking that takes us away from the original spirit of the web. Even in its ideals when it was created, the web was very idealistic. It wasn't about taking over, the web never said, let's take over [Gopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)) let's kill Gopher. That wasn't the idea. It was about enabling more people to get together.

So user-hostile for me is when the goals and the incentives of the system are not aligned with the goals and the intentions of the users. And even further, I would argue they go against the goals of the user. Because I don't think most users, if they really realized, want to be angry with their neighbors, want to be constantly scared, or constantly get the notion that someone's out to get them, or constantly bombarded with news or thoughts that cause stress and anxiety. I don't think these are user interests, but this is how they prosper. So this is, to me, user-hostile.

There's another element to this: surveillance capitalism, which is user-hostile in the sense that we started seeing users as a means to monetizing money. It's so normal now that even when I work with companies building websites, the marketing departments say, "Let's just collect the data and see what to do with it." The implications of that data collection aren't really obvious. It's improved with [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) in Europe, but still not clear.

We look at users as marketing touchpoints. That doesn't help. It dehumanizes users—because in the end, they are users.

**Yeah, I totally see it the same way. That's actually one of the reasons we're doing these interviews everyone's chasing SEO, buying content, playing the algorithms. But we just want to create something real, talk directly to people, and not worry about gatekeepers. It's wild how much we've let these systems come between real relationships. Like you said, if my business doesn't work without Google, that's not a good thing.**

And you're right. We've allowed the gatekeepers to be there, and it was almost insidious because it happened slowly. Technology is complex, and when a promise is abused, it's natural that we still get excited and adopt it. Anybody would.

But now, you could argue the responsibility also lies with those who hold that power. We're not quite there yet. We've given them the power, but we haven't held them accountable at the same level. We're trying, but it's hard. Tech moves fast, and legislation moves very slowly.

**Yeah, I totally get that. I believe in capitalism too especially when it comes to small business. But big tech? They're not customer centric at all. Like [VMWare](https://mastiffsystems.com/blog/On-Linux-VMware-and-Broadcom/) they make moves that benefit shareholders, not customers. Honestly, modern big tech often feels anti good customer experience.**

We all sort of believed that Google, their slogan, right? "Do no evil." In hindsight, it's funny how it was phrased as a double negative. That is also very interesting.

It's hard to tell if something is natural, but there seems to be a prerogative that comes with size. As a company grows, decision-making becomes more decentralized or highly centralized. There's more management and less time spent actually doing the thing the company set out to do. I think that's structural. I don't know how much of that was planned.

But the service that a lot of these systems provided, and I grew up with them too—[AltaVista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaVista), Northern Light, [Lycos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycos) it's hard to imagine now. Back then, most of us didn't think of these entities as companies. At least I didn't, as a kid. They were just services.

We didn't think about the infrastructure or the markets behind it, or what made it possible for these companies to provide those services for free. We just didn't think about it.

**Right. Yeah, I didn't either, for sure.**

And there's a lot of power in that. For me, the biggest challenge is the amount of influence these companies have in shaping opinions in ways that aren't always obvious. Every company wants to gain market share. That's how companies work.

We've known for a long time, even before the 1960s, that news media carries bias and can shape agendas. Now it's become more insidious because these platforms have incentives tied directly to engagement. And "engagement" is a euphemism for people getting angry at each other.

It's not positive for society, but it's very effective at generating ad revenue. That incentive has taken us down a very unfortunate path.

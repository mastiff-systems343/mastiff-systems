Before the airships, before the game engines—there was a pancake parlor. It began with Papa’s Pancakeria, where a young dreamer tapped through levels and whispered: “I want to build this.” What followed was less destiny and more stubborn invention. By August 2020, MJ was crafting games solo, turning coffee-fueled nights into pixel-perfect realities. By mid-2021, their art was on commission, their sprites dancing in indie realms across the net.

Whether conjuring cozy corners or animating chaotic battles, MJ designs with intention—every tile placed with an unseen logic born of sharp detail, organized chaos, and an uncanny ability to map out the big picture before a single pixel hits the page.


**Skills:**

- Builds intuitive game flows from scratch—eyes on the whole board, hands on every detail

- Organizes design assets like a librarian of light and layers

- Makes pixels feel alive, stories feel tactile, and interfaces feel human


**Hobbies:**

Beyond the glowing screen, MJ is kinetic energy in disguise. When not shrimpening at their desk (their word), they’re dancing—literally. From provincial dance championships to guest church performances, rhythm moves them as much as rhythm games do. Their gaming tastes are eclectic: cozy life-sims, stylish action titles, and beat maps that demand reflex and soul.


**Favorite Music:**

Depending on the vibe, it’s either afrobeats and dancehall from artists like Wizkid and Vybz Kartel or the brooding pull of dark R&B—Chase Atlantic, Kehlani, Kid Travis. Their playlists might bounce or brood, but either way, the soundtrack always matches the mission.

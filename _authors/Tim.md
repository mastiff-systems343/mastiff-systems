For over 23 years, Tim has shaped the silent engines of the digital world: data. From early schematics to modern warehousing, he’s mapped the flow of information like a cartographer of code—refining, tuning, and optimizing until every query sings. Specializing in reporting, ETL, and data warehouse architecture, Tim is a Microsoft-certified professional in Transact-SQL and Power BI, with Python and PowerShell always within reach of his toolkit.

He’s not just a database admin—he’s a craftsman of clarity, turning rows into revelations and systems into symphonies of structure.


**Skills:**

- Expert in data modeling, performance tuning, and database management

- Fluent in Python, PowerShell, and all things SQL

- Designs scalable architectures that turn data into decisions


**Hobbies:**

When the terminals dim, Tim picks up an instrument, heads to the water to fish, or retreats to his workshop to shape wood and invent the next little marvel. A lifelong tinkerer, he finds joy in building—whether it's queries, tables, tunes, or tools.


**Favorite Music:**

The Midnight – smooth, nostalgic, and synth-filled. Perfect background for both late-night coding and deep thinking.

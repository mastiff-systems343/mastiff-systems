I"2<p>Not all heroes wield swords—some carry SSH keys and boot into the unknown. Fitzken’s journey began in the humming halls of virtual machines and firewalls, where he forged a Proxmox hypervisor cluster spanning five mighty nodes. From configuring backups through NFS channels to migrating entire fleets of servers, he’s earned a reputation for keeping systems running when others falter. He’s worked with hosting giants like Bluehost and OVH, steering infrastructure through outages and upgrades with calm, clockwork precision.</p>

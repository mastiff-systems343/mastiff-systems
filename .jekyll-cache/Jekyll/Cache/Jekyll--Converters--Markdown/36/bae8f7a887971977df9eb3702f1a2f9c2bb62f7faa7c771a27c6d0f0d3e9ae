I"≠&<p>Welcome Back!</p>

<p>This post is part of our ongoing Cybersecurity Essentials series for small and medium-sized business (SMB) owners and non-technical teams. If you‚Äôve ever felt overwhelmed by IT security jargon, you‚Äôre in the right place. We‚Äôre here to make these important topics simple and actionable so you can protect your business without needing a degree in computer science.</p>

<p>Today, we‚Äôre diving into one of the most common cyber threats facing SMBs: phishing and email-based attacks.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-phishing-and-why-should-you-care">What Is Phishing and Why Should You Care?</h4>

<p>Phishing is a type of cyber attack where criminals pose as someone you trust‚Äîlike a customer, supplier, or bank‚Äîin an attempt to trick you into revealing sensitive information or clicking a malicious link. These scams often arrive via email, but they can also show up through text messages, social media, or messaging apps.</p>

<p>Think: fake invoices, urgent requests from ‚Äúthe boss,‚Äù or phony password reset emails.</p>

<p>According to <strong>Verizon‚Äôs 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report</strong>, about <strong>75% of breaches involve the human element</strong>, including phishing, social engineering, and human error. And while large companies make headlines, SMBs are especially vulnerable, they often lack formal training and protections, lack dedicated IT teams, and their teams are more likely to click something suspicious.</p>

  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-nyc/press-release/hungarian-man-pleads-guilty"><strong>Facebook &amp; Google (2013‚Äì2015)</strong></a>
A phishing campaign tricked employees at both companies into paying over <strong>$100 million</strong> in fake invoices. The attacker impersonated a real supplier, Quanta Computer, and sent convincing-looking payment requests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf"><strong>Elara Caring (2020)</strong></a>
This U.S. healthcare provider fell victim when attackers accessed employee email accounts through phishing. The breach exposed personal data of over <strong>100,000 elderly patients</strong>, including names, Social Security numbers, insurance, and financial information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-fake-zoom-invite-led-to-a-hedge-fund-being-wound-up/"><strong>Levitas Capital (2020)</strong></a>
A hedge fund company fell victim to a whaling attack (a phishing attack specifically targeting high-level executives) via a fake Zoom link sent to its co-founder. The malware led to fraudulent invoices totaling <strong>$8.7 million</strong>. Though only <strong>$800,000</strong> was lost, the reputational damage caused Levitas to lose its biggest client and ultimately shut down.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-phishing-works">How Phishing Works</h4>

<p>Phishing relies on <strong>social engineering</strong>, manipulating people into doing something risky, like clicking a link, entering credentials, or paying invoices. It usually starts with a message that appears to be from someone you trust, such as your bank, a vendor, or a colleague.</p>

<p><strong>The Bait</strong><br />
Phishing can take many forms, not just email:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Email phishing</strong>: The classic scam, ‚ÄúClick to reset your password‚Äù or ‚ÄúYour invoice is attached.‚Äù</li>
  <li><strong>Spear phishing</strong>: A more targeted version, customized to you or your role.</li>
  <li><strong>Smishing</strong>: Fake texts (‚ÄúYour package is delayed. Track here: ‚Ä¶‚Äù)</li>
  <li><strong>Vishing</strong>: Scam phone calls impersonating tech support or financial institutions, increasingly using AI-generated voices.</li>
  <li><strong>Social media phishing</strong>: DMs with fake job offers or account alerts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Hook</strong><br />
Once the bait lands, the attacker pushes you to act quickly, like clicking a link, opening an attachment, or logging in to a fake website. These actions are designed to feel routine and urgent, lowering your defenses.</p>

<p><strong>The Catch</strong><br />
When you follow through, that‚Äôs when the real damage happens. Depending on what you clicked or entered, attackers might:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Steal your passwords or credentials</li>
  <li>Install malware or ransomware</li>
  <li>Access your company‚Äôs files, emails, or financial systems</li>
  <li>Impersonate you to scam others in your organization</li>
  <li>Redirect payments or steal funds directly</li>
</ul>

<p>Often, the person who was phished doesn‚Äôt even realize it immediately. That‚Äôs why prevention and early detection are critical.</p>

<h4 id="how-to-spot-a-phishing-email">How to Spot a Phishing Email</h4>

<p>Phishing can be delivered by email, text, phone, or even chat platforms, but the red flags are often the same:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Urgency</strong>: Pressure to act fast, ‚Äúreset now,‚Äù ‚Äúaccount suspended,‚Äù or ‚Äúboss needs this ASAP‚Äù</li>
  <li><strong>Spelling and grammar mistakes</strong>: Many phishing emails are poorly written</li>
  <li><strong>Suspicious links</strong>: Hover over links (don‚Äôt click) to check where they actually go</li>
  <li><strong>Unexpected attachments</strong>: Be wary of strange or unsolicited files</li>
  <li><strong>Lookalike email addresses</strong>: Slight changes like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">support@micros0ft.com</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">microsoft.com</code></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-you-can-protect-yourself">How You Can Protect Yourself</h4>

<p>Phishing targets <strong>people</strong>, not just systems, so a few smart habits go a long way. Here‚Äôs what we recommend:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Train Your Team</strong><br />
Educate employees about phishing. Share examples like this article, and include cybersecurity in onboarding and ongoing training.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong><br />
MFA adds an extra layer of protection. Even if a password is stolen, the attacker won‚Äôt get in without the second step.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enable Email Filtering Tools</strong><br />
Most platforms (like Google Workspace or Microsoft 365) offer built-in filters to detect spam, suspicious links, and spoofed senders. Use them, and mark suspicious messages accordingly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Run a Phishing Drill</strong><br />
Send your team a simulated phishing email once or twice a year. It‚Äôs a safe way to measure awareness and reinforce training.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Adopt a ‚ÄúPause and Verify‚Äù Culture</strong><br />
Encourage employees to double-check unusual requests especially those involving money or login credentials by contacting the person directly using known contact info.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="dont-let-hackers-impersonate-you">Don‚Äôt Let Hackers Impersonate You</h4>

<p>The tips above protect you <strong>from</strong> phishing but what if someone tries to phish <strong>as you</strong>?</p>

<p>Hackers can spoof your company‚Äôs email address and trick your clients into paying fake invoices. Even if you‚Äôre not breached, it can still harm your brand and customer trust.</p>

<p>To stop this, set up three simple email protections:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>SPF</strong>: Lists allowed email servers (your company) &amp; blocks unauthorized senders</li>
  <li><strong>DKIM</strong>: Adds a digital signature to emails to prove the message wasn‚Äôt altered</li>
  <li><strong>DMARC</strong>: Tells mail servers how to handle failed SPF/DKIM checks. Stops spoofed messages &amp; provides reports</li>
</ul>

<p>Once set up (usually by your IT provider or domain host), these tools run automatically to help protect your clients and your reputation.</p>

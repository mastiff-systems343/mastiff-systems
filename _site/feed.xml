                <title>Welcome to Our Cybersecurity Blog Series</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Mastiff Systems’ new blog series on cybersecurity. We’re dedicated to helping our partners protect their businesses from digital threats. Whether you’re a solo practitioner or manage a team , this series is designed to provide non-technical business owners and managers with the tools and knowledge they need to navigate today’s complex security landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-cybersecurity-matters-for-small-businesses&quot;&gt;Why Cybersecurity Matters for Small Businesses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s interconnected world, no business is too small to be targeted by cybercriminals. While high-profile breaches at large corporations make headlines, small to medium-sized businesses including dental practices, law firms, and local service providers are increasingly in the crosshairs. If your office manages sensitive data like financial records, patient information, or confidential client communications, cybersecurity should be a top operational priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some eye-opening statistics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;61% of small businesses were targeted by a cyberattack in 2021 (Verizon, 2023)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;43% of all data breaches involve small and medium-sized businesses (IBM, 2022)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The average cost of a breach for SMBs is $120,000 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hiscox.com&quot;&gt;(Hiscox, 2021)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;60% of affected small businesses shut down within six months &lt;a href=&quot;https://staysafeonline.org&quot;&gt;(U.S. National Cyber Security Alliance)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cybercriminals target smaller businesses because they often lack in-house security teams or dedicated IT personnel. For dental offices, this means patient records are attractive targets. For legal and financial firms, it’s confidential documents and data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-cybersecurity&quot;&gt;What Is Cybersecurity?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting your data, systems, and devices from unauthorized access, theft, or damage. For a small or medium-sized office, this includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Safeguarding client and patient information&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preventing malware, ransomware, and phishing attacks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Backing up essential files&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Training staff to recognize cyber threats&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complying with regulations like HIPAA, PCI-DSS, or FTC Safeguards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity isn’t just a technical issue—it’s essential for business continuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-consequences-of-a-cyberattack-can-include&quot;&gt;The Consequences of a Cyberattack Can Include:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Financial loss from fraud or ransom payments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Downtime and productivity loss&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Damage to your business’s reputation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Legal penalties and regulatory fines (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially important if you handle sensitive data . If your business deals with personal or financial data, you may be subject to regulations such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HIPAA for healthcare and dental offices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PCI-DSS for processing credit card payments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FTC Safeguards Rule for financial services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;State-level privacy laws, such as California’s CCPA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noncompliance can result in fines, legal action, and loss of client trust. Implementing cybersecurity best practices helps you meet these standards and build credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-to-expect-from-this-blog-series&quot;&gt;What to Expect from This Blog Series&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to break down key cybersecurity concepts into actionable insights that any business owner can understand. Each post will feature real-world examples and step-by-step guidance to help protect your office.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Experimenting with all paid internet services and enshittification </title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;As of late I have been thinking a lot about just how bad the internet has gotten. Google search is almost useless as it’s full of ads and not real links for page after page. Content farms and bots have made actual human content hard to find. Social media is just a giant manipulative echo chamber and it’s all done in the name of business and extracting every last penny from the user of the site. If you haven’t heard of the dead internet theory you should read up on it. I don’t know that I fully subscribe to the entire premise which is, that the internet is made by robots not humans but it sure seems like at least some of the internet is dead and that all this content is generated for the advertisers’ benefit. With AI in the mix it certainly seems so and even my local news webpage is so full of ads that it almost seems not credible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily the small web is a growing movement and hopefully it continues to gain traction. The small web is real websites lovingly created by hand by actual people. That’s how we tried to make our own website. This is why we built it from scratch, with no content management engine like WordPress. It’s as good as we can code it. I have a lot to say about the small web but that’s another article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main issues it seems is that the users of these products are not the actual customers of the business. Facebook/Meta and Google’s real customers are the advertisers and not the end user. This leads the business to add features to their products that benefit advertisers even if it hurts the end user experience. Creating an almost &lt;a href=&quot;https://neustadt.fr/essays/against-a-user-hostile-web&quot;&gt;hostile (or user-hateful) end user experience&lt;/a&gt; there is a term for this, where products get worse over time, it’s called enshitification. When I was at DEF CON this last year the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/4EmstuO0Em8?si=zU-0PaI9ixjOE1kE&quot;&gt;EFF&lt;/a&gt; gave a great talk on the topic and I was in the audience to hear. Is worth a watch and Adam Conover does a great job covering it &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/P7NHABs76mg?si=aXdhpxr3tyMicV-D&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After thinking about the issue with ads and internet I wanted to try a lifestyle experiment. What if I used paid internet services in my personal life to avoid ads? I always like to test things out myself, and I personally HATE ads in any capacity so I set out to try and replace free services with paid ones. If the service is paid then YOU are the customer, not advertisers. When you are the customer it gives the company incentive to make their product the best possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off let’s talk about email. As much as I love Gmail as a product, Google does not care about your privacy at all despite what their marketing may say. You are most valuable to them as a digital asset where they can harvest your data for advertising. There is a company called 37signals that makes a product called Basecamp that we live and die by here at Mastiff. I would even say we could hardly run the business without it. It’s an incredible product that is fairly priced and works great. I wish it was open source but otherwise I have no complaints. I have read the 37signals blog for years and I have really appreciated their views on business and how capitalism should work in a modern tech-driven world. So I was quite intrigued to find that they started their own email service called hey.com. Of course I had to try it out immediately, it costs $5 a month and doesn’t use ads at all nor do they harvest user data, since they charge for the service. Their approach to email is innovative to say the least. I have switched my personal email on over to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey is interesting in that it approaches email differently than Google or Microsoft. It seems their company goal is to make email useful again and to minimize the noise that ends up in all our inboxes. There are basically three sections, the main inbox, a paper trail for receipts and “feed” to see your emails in a large and beautiful way. Another thing it does differently is that you have to approve every sender at first. If you don’t approve of the sender you won’t see their emails. You can also hit “set aside” or “save for later” on your emails and it will remind you to follow up. I use my own domain for my personal email @bleedingpeanutbutter.com that way I can change email providers without changing my email address and hey.com lets me do that. Once you learn the keyboard shortcuts for hey.com it becomes quite powerful and fast to browse through only the emails you want without distraction. It’s a very forward thinking approach and I like seeing the 37signals guys fighting against the email monopoly of Google and Microsoft. We need more and more email hosts in fact. That way email will stay an open standard not controlled by any one company. I highly recommend Hey.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next paid service to discuss is YouTube Premium. As a lifelong musician &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleedingpeanutbutter.com/articles/love-letter-to-the-bass-guitar&quot;&gt;(I started playing bass at 15)&lt;/a&gt;, I have to say it makes me quite jealous to see the kids coming up with YouTube to learn songs and how to play. What an amazing advantage. We had to figure it out through trial and error, or Bass Player magazine or get a VHS instructional video and those were hard to come by and expensive. To have this entire world of knowledge at your fingertips is just incredible. I use YouTube daily for learning about technology or music or gardening or just anything. So I decided to pay the monthly fee to not see ads constantly and it’s well worth the price of admission. Content creators still try and sneak sponsorship marketing in their videos but I’m OK with that as that’s how they fund their channel. I do NOT want to see intrusive and interruptive advertising. In that sense YouTube Premium is well worth the money. When I go to a YouTube video not signed in to my account it’s almost jarring. This one I have to ask how people live without. It’s like two different products, the ads on YouTube standard are so intrusive. This one is a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, I wanted to get away from Google search. Google search was once a crowning achievement of the internet, they were the search to beat. But over the last five years or so it has just become a mess. Pages of sponsored ads and bad AI advice is all you see at Google search now. Run don’t walk away. I have been using duckduckgo.com for quite a while, and I would say it’s now superior to Google search but I don’t see how over the long term they won’t fall into the same traps, since their actual customers are their advertisers. Now if you do nothing else after reading this you should switch to duckduckgo.com for search. It’s quite good these days. But then I discovered Kagi.com, it’s a paid-only search engine. A paid search engine is interesting, it’s the only economical business model I can think of where the user of the product is the actual customer. It’s $10 a month, and I thought if $10 a month isn’t worth it for your most used feature on the internet then what is? So I signed up and gave it a go and it’s amazing. It feels like the old internet again, with relevant results and no ads anywhere in the search results. They are also a huge proponent of the small web. I like that a lot. I cannot recommend Kagi enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing I wanted to discuss was general news. It’s not difficult to see that news in the US has become completely unreliable. Half the “news” that we see is opinion anyway and post removal of the fairness doctrine in the 80’s it’s become completely polarizing. Years ago I realized that at minimum the goal of the news was to sell tomorrow’s news. The easiest way to do that was to focus on negative stories. Negativity keeps people tuned in. It keeps eyeballs on the station. So let’s not even talk about how news is manipulated by the government and large corporations. At its very core mainstream news WANTS you scared. That just wasn’t for me so I decided to not consume any major news with any regularity. If I want to understand a new bill I read the bill, if I want to see what’s going on with some world event I find the expert and listen to them. I try to get as close to the source as possible. So what’s the best way to get good news with minimum noise? Well that’s still a work in progress but I have found Substack to be fantastic. You can follow an actual scientist or doctor or whatever expert you want quite directly. Now I would say always do your due diligence to vet the person before you follow them and make sure they are credible and always keep a skeptical eye on anything you read. Fact check with peer-reviewed work and fact check the fact checkers. But you can get to the heart of the matter a lot quicker with a direct conversation with the expert. I have also found Patreon to have similar benefits. I subscribe to several Patreon channels myself and I love being able to fund these creators directly rather than have to go through the gatekeeper of big tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet can still be a very human place, but it takes some work and apparently some extra money. My day-to-day use of the internet is calming rather than chaotic now that I have almost no ads in my day-to-day world. To keep the internet a free place, maybe we do need to fund these smaller companies that fight to stay independent in a world of “maximum monetization” and tech bros that view people as possible engagement resources to be bled dry. Don’t underestimate the value of your attention to these companies. Right now we are selling it quite cheap and it’s time for a change. For now I will use the paid independent internet.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>How to setup power monitoring virtual machine for VMware</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Monitoring power consumption is essential for making smarter decisions, reducing costs, and promoting sustainability—whether you’re managing a data center, a smart home, or a renewable energy project. A power monitoring virtual machine (VM) simplifies this process by offering a centralized platform to collect, analyze, and visualize energy data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we’ll walk you through setting up a power monitoring VM, covering essential tools, software, and configurations to streamline your energy management. Let’s get started and optimize your setup!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Virtual Machine Host
  You’ll need either VMware ESXi or Proxmox Virtual Environment installed on your server.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)
  Your UPS should have either a USB or Ethernet port for communication.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/monitoring-vm/1-UPS.png&quot; alt=&quot;UPS&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Virtual Machine Image
  Typically downloadable from the manufacturer’s website, usually in .VMDK format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/monitoring-vm/2-overview.png&quot; alt=&quot;System Overview&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; style=&quot;padding: 10px;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example setup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a physical server connected to the UPS using both power and data via USB.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A hypervisor (ESXi or Proxmox) is already installed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll use the manufacturer’s utility image to deploy the power monitoring VM.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;⚠️ Note: The monitoring system used in this guide supports VMware ESXi only.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step-by-Step Setup Guide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/monitoring-vm/3-esxi.png&quot; alt=&quot;ESXI&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; style=&quot;padding: 10px;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Verify UPS Detection via SSH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    - Login to your VMware host through SSH.&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/monitoring-vm/4-ssh.png&quot; alt=&quot;We logged in as root&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; style=&quot;padding: 10px;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;At the prompt, type &lt;code&gt;lsusb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This command will list all USB devices connected to your physical server.
    &lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/monitoring-vm/5-lsusb.png&quot; alt=&quot;Success, VMware is able to detect the UPS&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; style=&quot;padding: 10px;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Download the VMDK image from the manufacturer’s website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    For this example, the UPS manufacturer is Cyber Power Systems.&lt;br /&gt;
    - If your UPS is connected via USB, download the first option.&lt;br /&gt;
    - If your UPS is connected via the network, download the second (remote) option.
    &lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/monitoring-vm/6-power-panel.png&quot; alt=&quot;Power Panel&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; style=&quot;padding: 10px;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;After downloading&lt;br /&gt;Unzip the file to extract the necessary image files.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    Login to the VMware web GUI and create a virtual machine.&lt;br /&gt;
    Select &lt;em&gt;Deploy a virtual machine from an OVF or OVA file&lt;/em&gt;, then click &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;.
    &lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/monitoring-vm/7-Virtual-machine.png&quot; alt=&quot;Select Creation Type&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; style=&quot;padding: 10px;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    Enter the name of the virtual machine (e.g., &lt;strong&gt;MonitorVM&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
    - Drag and drop the &lt;code&gt;.ovf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.vmdk&lt;/code&gt; files into the box.&lt;br /&gt;
    - Click &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt; once they are loaded.
    &lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/monitoring-vm/8-monitor-vm.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; style=&quot;padding: 10px;&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/monitoring-vm/8-monitor-vm-2.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; style=&quot;padding: 10px;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    Choose the storage location.&lt;br /&gt;
    For this example, we only have one option. Click &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;.
    &lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/monitoring-vm/8-monitor-vm-3.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; style=&quot;padding: 10px;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    Select Thin Provisioning.&lt;br /&gt;
    - Untick &lt;strong&gt;Power on automatically&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
    - Click &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;.
    &lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/monitoring-vm/8-monitor-vm-4.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; style=&quot;padding: 10px;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    Review the configuration and click &lt;strong&gt;Finish&lt;/strong&gt;.
    &lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/monitoring-vm/8-monitor-vm-5.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; style=&quot;padding: 10px;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    Wait for the virtual machine to finish creating.
    &lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/monitoring-vm/9-creation.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; style=&quot;padding: 10px;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    Configure the power monitoring VM.&lt;br /&gt;

                <title>Why Commodore should have ruled the world</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Of all the computer manufactures, Commodore has probably made the most significant impact on the industry and many gamers have never heard of them. Commodore Business Machines was founded in Toronto, Canada in 1962.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many computer companies they began by making calculators. They also invented the first pocket calculator. The company launched several home computer systems but the major success was the Commodore 64 in 1982. After the company’s success, they purchased Amiga Computers. The Amiga computer is, at this point in technological history, the best selling home computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the amazing systems Commodore produced, it seems the company’s business decisions were not ( amazing. ) Consequently, on Friday, April 29 at 4:10 P.M., Commodore filed for liquidation. Commodore may be gone but the impact they made on the industry remains. Truly, they are the company that did not produce computers strictly for businesses. The home computer became a reality for the general public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commodore 64 was the first computer I ever owned. It made the Apple IIE’s we where using at school look pathetic. The sound and graphic chip sets were simply amazing, given the technological time period. Then I switched to an Amiga 600. This machine was AWESOME! It made my IBM owning friends quite jealous. Of course I didn’t have a harddrive back then, and the O.S. loaded off floppies every time I wanted to use it. It was only two to three floppies but annoying none the less. The O.S. was worlds ahead of what Microsoft, IBM, and Apple where doing at the time. Had Commodore played their cards right they could currently be where Microsoft is today. Unfortunately, bad business decision after bad business decision caught up with the company. It was mind boggling to watch. How could a company make such amazing products and yet not know how to effectively market those products?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the early 1990’s I had amassed a collection of around 300 Commodore 64 games (if I remember correctly.) A player could get some great games for free. If a person subscribed to publications such as Computer’s Gazette, he/she actually got games with every magazine. The only problem was typing all the code in to get the game/s .That’s right- every magazine came with pages and pages of binary code. All the gamer needed to do was type in that code. It was not uncommon to work 16+ hours of typing. None the less, many classic games came out of the Commodore era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today there is still a huge Commodore following, and there are many emulators for the system. Just google Commodore 64 emulators and see what I mean. If you have the time and want to see a part of gaming history, I recommend playing a few Commodore games, here are some links to a great emulator: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.computerbrains.com/ccs64/&quot;&gt;http://www.computerbrains.com/ccs64/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.c64.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.c64.com/&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commodore…….ahh the memories.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>A company scanned Apple cables compared to cheaper knock off’s</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Check out the full report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lumafield.com/article/usb-c-cable-charger-head-to-head-comparison-apple-thunderbolt-amazon-basics&quot;&gt;USB-C head-to-head comparison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But just look at the photos&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/cable/cables.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mag safe stand&quot; title=&quot;Optional Title&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one reason Apple gets a reputation for being more “expensive” but you
can’t tell me those are the same cables. You really do get what you pay for here in
both speed and longer term reliability. Job’s famously said “Apple doesn’t know
how to make junk” and despite a few missteps here and there, this seems true.
When it comes to technology the devils in the details and Apple does detail better
than anyone.
I’m sure they have good margin on these, of course. But it’s not the highway
robbery people think it is.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>IOS 17 standby mode</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;How I finally replaced my noise machine and nightstand clock with my iphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my quest for minimalism i’m always looking at how a device can fill multiple rolls so I need less items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the new standby mode I can replace my bed side clock. I have also been playing with using my iPhone to replace my noise machine that I did have setup with HomeKit to turn on at 9pm and off at 11pm. Using my phone is a bit more manual but i like that it’s very intentional. It is nice when I travel that I have the same noise machine on the road as I do at home. So I got a mag safe stand and have that and one HomeKit light by my bed. It looks a lot cleaner and it’s simpler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/ios/Mag safe stand.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mag safe stand&quot; title=&quot;Optional Title&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought a Maxonar stand for $26 and it works great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I’m not overly impressed by how standby mode is setup by default. Why an old school analog clock? Why have it so I can only edit the standby widgets when it’s on a charger? Thats kind of a pain. Hopefully Apple will add features to test. Maybe we will also see third party widgets one day? It could also be that I’m learning how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing some playing with it, I can see that if you swipe over you can change what is displayed. I was able to get a tiny clock in the corner and that works well. Is there a way to customize the color? we will see. See what I have so far…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/ios/display-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Display option 1&quot; title=&quot;Display option 1&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/ios/display-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Display option 2&quot; title=&quot;Display option 2&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/ios/display-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Display option 3&quot; title=&quot;Display option 3&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/ios/display-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Display option 4&quot; title=&quot;Display option 4&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also swipe up and down for different clock faces. This is the one I like the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/ios/display-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Display option 5&quot; title=&quot;Display option 5&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the functionality I had hoped for with IOS 17. It seems like a tiny feature but it’s a game changer for me. I loved the giant alarm buttons. It will be interesting to see how I can continue to integrate this in to everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you didn’t know. iOS and iPadOS have a sound machine built in. In the past I would use an app to turn my phone in to a white noise machine so I can sleep better at night. It’s a total game changer for me. I think it was added around iOS 14 or 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you need to do is launch the settings app, the search background sounds and turn on the sound you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/ios/audio visual settings.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Audio and visual settings&quot; title=&quot;Audio and visual settings&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/ios/background sounds settings.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Background sounds settings&quot; title=&quot;Background sounds settings&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could even get fancy and create an automation with shortcuts like I did below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/ios/background sounds settings-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Background sounds settings 2&quot; title=&quot;Background sounds settings 2&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this automation, it turns on my noise machine. Turns on my goodnight home automation scene, which locks my doors and turns of all my nights and then plays some calm music in my bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you could even start a fitness plus meditation for sleep. Like this one&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/ios/meditation app.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Meditation app&quot; title=&quot;Meditation app&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is quite remarkable how well this all works. Steve Jobs was all in on the arts and especially music. Where Tim Cook is passionate about health and it shows with things like this. Now I can just bring my stand with me when I’m traveling and in one small package I have my exact setup for sleep that I do at home. Makes sleeping so much easier when I’m not in my own bed. Tying it all in to HomeKit makes it even more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Using Apple shortcuts to remember to request payment</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I have two of my kids on my car insurance since it’s cheaper for them, so they pay
me directly for it every month rather than pay the bill themselves. I also had them
on my phone plan up until recently. But it’s easy to forget to request that payment
and the kids certainly aren’t motivated to remember. Certainly there was a way to
automate this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My solution after a lot of trial and error was to use the shortcuts app to create an
automation to request the payment via Apple Pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/shortcuts/image.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sample Image&quot; title=&quot;Optional Title&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/shortcuts/image-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sample Image&quot; title=&quot;Optional Title&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see for my kids. One shortcut each. Then I created a recurring
reminder with a link to the shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/shortcuts/image-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sample Image&quot; title=&quot;Optional Title&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get a pop up reminder on the first of every month, and I just click on the reminder
and it runs the shortcut and requests the money. The system works pretty well and
I haven’t forgotten to ask them since.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>5 Cool Tips to Upgrade Your Notion Dashboard</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ve made a simple Notion dashboard and are now looking to take it to the next level? Here are a few cool tips to make your dashboard work for you instead of you working on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relate Multiple Data Sets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have two databases that are related, you can connect them using the relation property so you don’t have to manually update each database separately. This feature is particularly useful for linking projects with tasks, clients with projects, or employees with their assignments. This way, you can easily view and manage related information in one place without duplicating data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Relation&quot; width=&quot;860&quot; height=&quot;515&quot; src=&quot;https://peertube-gftks-u25423.vm.elestio.app/videos/embed/7240c82e-41e5-4a11-9bcc-b04d3eb1dc90&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Routine Actions in One Click&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the button feature, you can automate routine actions, such as creating a new page, inserting blocks, or editing pages, all with a single click. Buttons are highly customizable, allowing you to tailor their functionality to suit specific needs or workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try creating a button to add a page to a database in one click.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Button&quot; width=&quot;860&quot; height=&quot;515&quot; src=&quot;https://peertube-gftks-u25423.vm.elestio.app/videos/embed/29808046-2283-49fe-8261-f1e1644a1c5a&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automate Updates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s another automation trick for databases: Triggers. Triggers reduce the need for manual updates and help keep your data consistent and up to date. For example, if you update an entry, you can set up an automation to automatically notify a group of people, eliminating the need to manually inform them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Trigger&quot; width=&quot;860&quot; height=&quot;515&quot; src=&quot;https://peertube-gftks-u25423.vm.elestio.app/videos/embed/9b65d5f6-8bf8-4da2-b06f-5ac10f09b09c&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:  I am doing this from my private space since this is just a demo but you have to do this in a teamspace in order for this to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create Templates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take advantage of templates. If you have a database where you frequently add similar pages, like client profiles, duplicating a page can require extra effort to remove existing client information. Instead, you can create a template with the same format, allowing you to quickly generate new client profiles without the extra cleanup. This saves time and keeps your workflow efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Template&quot; width=&quot;860&quot; height=&quot;515&quot; src=&quot;https://peertube-gftks-u25423.vm.elestio.app/videos/embed/d0da4a35-694d-47ec-a6b6-fb0e58a42b57&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notion Formulas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you a fan of Excel? Then you might want to explore Notion’s formulas. Notion formulas allow you to create dynamic, calculated fields within databases, enabling powerful features like calculations, conditional formatting, and logical operations. For example, you can easily track your monthly expenses using a simple formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title=&quot;Formula&quot; width=&quot;860&quot; height=&quot;515&quot; src=&quot;https://peertube-gftks-u25423.vm.elestio.app/videos/embed/caa9f21a-e44c-4937-a55a-d1031f2db41d&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These small changes will definitely transform your work dashboard. Give them a try and see how they can improve your Notion experience!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Tips for Notion Newcomers</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Notion is one of the tools that Mastiff uses to organize our documents and information. It serves as our centralized hub for information, collaboration, and knowledge-sharing. We’ve built our wiki, library, and various work dashboards in Notion. It’s incredibly flexible—think of it like a blank canvas where you can create whatever you need. But I know all that freedom can feel a bit overwhelming at first. So, let me walk you through some basics to help you get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customize Your Page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create pages for almost anything and personalize them with various types of content, such as text, images, databases, and more. You can choose from a range of pre-made emojis and icons as visual cues for your pages, or upload your own photos from your computer. You also have the option to select images from Unsplash, which offers a wide range of high-quality stock photos. Although the font color and text background options are somewhat limited, they still provide effective color-coding features for organizing sections and highlighting important information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organize Your Pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I LOVE databases! If you have a lot of pages, a full-page database can become your best friend. Think of it as a super-organized filing cabinet for all your content. Databases are one of the more complex blocks in Notion, but that’s because they offer so much functionality. You can set up automation, apply filters, and sort data efficiently. If you’re just getting started, begin by adding properties tailored to your needs. They’re fantastic for organizing and quickly searching through a pool of pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Same Data, Multiple Views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve got your database set up, you can view your data in all sorts of ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table View: A spreadsheet-like layout to view and manage a large amount of data at once. It’s ideal for sorting, filtering, and viewing multiple properties of your data side by side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Board View: A Kanban-style board, perfect for tracking tasks through different stages or categories. Organize tasks by status, priority, or any categorical property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;List View: A simple linear view of data. It provides a minimalist approach to view records one by one with key properties visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timeline View: A chronological timeline for your data, great for project planning, tracking deadlines, and scheduling. It provides a visual representation of your tasks or events over time, making it easier to see overlaps and gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calendar View: For scheduling and managing time-based data like appointments, meetings, or deadlines, Notion’s calendar view is ideal. It allows you to see your tasks and events in a monthly, weekly, or daily format, making it easy to keep track of what’s coming up. A great feature of Notion’s calendar is that it can send you notifications, ensuring you never forget important events. Plus, you can connect it with Google Calendar or Outlook to sync all your schedules in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallery View: Provides a visual representation of your data, showcasing items as cards with an emphasis on images. It’s ideal for portfolios, mood boards, or any data where visual elements are important, such as team directories or project showcases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chart View: Useful for tracking progress on projects, analyzing performance metrics, or visualizing complex datasets in a more digestible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collaborate with Your Team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve created a simple dashboard in Notion, you can easily share it with your team to facilitate collaboration. Notion serves as a central hub for storing team documents, notes, tasks, and databases, all in one accessible location, which helps keep everyone aligned and on the same page. Notion’s permission management features allow you to control access levels, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected while still encouraging effective collaboration. You can assign different permission levels based on each role, providing just the right amount of access each member needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When adding a team member to Notion, you can select their level of access—Full Access, Can Edit, Can Comment, or View Only—depending on their role and responsibilities. For finalized documents or templates, you can use Notion’s “Lock Page” feature to prevent accidental changes. If you’re managing a larger team or organization, creating groups and assigning permissions at the group level is more efficient than setting permissions for each user individually, helping streamline access management and maintain consistent permissions across the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add Widgets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further enhance your Notion workspace, consider adding widgets. These can include productivity tools and real-time data displays. Platforms like Apption.co offer a variety of options to augment your Notion setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notion is incredibly flexible, which is both its strength and the source of initial overwhelm. Take it one step at a time, and don’t be afraid to experiment. As you grow more comfortable with the basics, you’ll discover countless ways to tailor Notion to your specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy organizing!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Data Insurance: Why Do Companies Need It (Or Not)?</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;For starters, What is Data Insurance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We define data insurance for a non-techy person as a safety net for businesses and people worried about cyber threats. It covers costs if sensitive data gets stolen or if there’s a cyberattack. It’s especially crucial today when businesses use a lot of digital tools and face more online risks. With data insurance, they can feel more secure knowing they’re protected financially if something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Insurance vs. Life Insurance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s break it down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life Insurance: This is a safety net for your family. If something happens to you and you can’t provide for them anymore, life insurance steps in to ensure they’re financially okay. It’s like giving them a big hug of support when you can’t be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Insurance: This acts as a shield. If hackers steal your sensitive information or mess with your online operations, data insurance comes to the rescue. It helps cover the costs of fixing the mess, like hiring experts or paying fines. It’s like having a superhero for your computer files, keeping them safe and sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Should You Get Data Insurance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider the advantages and disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace of Mind: It’s like having a safety net. If something bad happens to your digital assets, you know you won’t be left hanging financially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helps Cover Costs: If hackers strike or you accidentally lose important data, the insurance helps pay for fixing the mess, such as hiring experts or dealing with legal issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protects Your Business: For companies, it’s like having a guardian for your digital side. If there’s a cyberattack, you can keep running smoothly without worrying about significant financial hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Costs Money: Like any insurance, you have to pay for it. Depending on the level of coverage you want, it can add up over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not Foolproof: It won’t stop cyberattacks or data breaches from happening. It just helps you recover financially after the damage is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policy Limits: Sometimes, there are limits on what the insurance will cover. You need to read the fine print to make sure you’re protected where you need it most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to research thoroughly before deciding whether to get data insurance. Assess your specific needs, the risks you face, and the coverage options available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data insurance can provide significant benefits, especially in an age where cyber threats are ever-present. However, it’s essential to weigh the costs and limitations to determine if it’s the right choice for you or your business.&lt;/p&gt;

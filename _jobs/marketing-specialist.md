## The Role

We need a Marketing Specialist who can drive real results across multiple brands. This isn't just posting on social media - you'll be managing ad budgets, building engaged communities, and creating campaigns that directly impact revenue.

* 3+ years of digital marketing with proven results in Google AdSense and Facebook Ads management, optimization, and conversion tracking
* Exceptional copywriting across multiple formats (ads, emails, landing pages, web content) for diverse audiences

* Experience with email marketing platforms, marketing automation tools, and analytics (Google Analytics, Facebook Insights)

**Character Requirements:**

- Self-starter who can manage multiple projects independently
- Excellent networking and outreach skills for securing blog interview guests
- Creative thinker who can develop unique marketing angles for different audiences

**Important Notes:**

This is a collaborative team environment. Your work will have direct impact on client outcomes and business success. We value transparency in our project management and believe in clear accountability for results.

We value competence over credentials. We'll test your actual knowledge, not just accept certifications or job titles. We may ask about technologies that don't exist to see how you handle unknown information.

Quality matters. Your work efficiency and technical expertise directly impact client relationships and project success. We support team members who deliver professional results.


### What We Offer:

- Remote work with flexible scheduling
- Continuous professional development - 10% of your time (4 hours/week) is dedicated to ongoing training in technical skills, communication, and interpersonal development

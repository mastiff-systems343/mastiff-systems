                    content: "Welcome back to Mastiff Systems’ Cybersecurity Essentials series. Last week, we demystified what a network is and how to protect the network and devices where your data flows. This week, we’re diving into password best practices, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and account hygiene — your core defenses that help safeguard your systems against unauthorized access.Why You Should CareA breach in account security can mean unauthorized access to sensitive client data, medical records, or confidential legal documents. Beyond data loss, it can lead to reputational damage, regulatory fines, and even lawsuits.Passwords are the first line of defense for nearly every system your business relies on — email, applications, file servers, Wi-Fi, and more. Yet, they remain one of the weakest links in cybersecurity. Combine that with poor account hygiene — like failing to revoke access for former employees or sharing credentials — and you’re just one exposed password away from a serious breach.According to 2019 research, weak or compromised passwords were the third leading cause of ransomware attacks, following lack of employee training and phishing.If you’re curious about the scale of these threats, here are links to public databases that track real-world breach incidents in the USA:  Medical Data Breaches (U.S.): HHS OCR Breach Portal  General Data Breaches (All Industries): Privacy Rights Clearinghouse  California-Specific Breach Notices: California Attorney General Breach ListReal-World Examples      McDonald’s McHire Chatbot (2025)Researchers discovered the admin account used the default password “123456,” exposing data of 64 million job applicants.        SolarWinds Breach (2020)Attackers accessed systems using a weak, publicly exposed password: “solarwinds123.” This led to a global supply-chain attack affecting thousands of organizations.        Medibank (2022)An infected personal device synced with saved corporate credentials gave attackers access to Medibank’s email and VPN. 520 GB of sensitive data was stolen due to lack of MFA.  How Attackers Steal PasswordsBefore we talk defense, here’s how attackers gain access:  Brute-force attacks: Rapidly guessing combinations until one works  Credential stuffing: Reusing stolen credentials from other breaches  Phishing: Tricking users into entering passwords on fake websites  Social engineering: Impersonating trusted people to extract credentials  Password spraying: Trying common passwords across many accountsOnce in, attackers may install malware, steal client data, or escalate their privileges — especially dangerous if MFA is not enabled.Best Practices for Passwords, MFA &amp; Account SecurityHere’s how to build strong defenses around your accounts:Use Strong, Unique Passwords  At least 12–16 characters  Mix of letters, numbers, symbols  Avoid names, dates, or reused passwords  Use passphrases for memorability (e.g., Correct-Battery-Staple)Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  Adds a second layer beyond your password  Use authenticator apps (Microsoft, Google) or hardware keys (YubiKey)  Avoid relying only on SMS or email for MFAPractice Good Account Hygiene  Audit access regularly — remove old or unused accounts  Apply least privilege — give only what’s necessary  Avoid shared accounts — each user should have their own  Monitor for suspicious login activityUse a Password Manager  Generates and stores strong passwords  Avoid storing passwords in spreadsheets or sticky notesPasswordless Login: A Safer FutureModern platforms (Google, Apple, Microsoft) are moving toward passwordless login. Instead of typing a password, you authenticate with:  Passkeys (Face ID, fingerprint, or device PIN)  Magic Links (email or SMS links for one-click login)  Biometric loginsThis approach is phishing-resistant, harder to steal, and improves user experience. Adoption is growing rapidly.A Deeper Dive: The CIA TriadThe foundation of cybersecurity is built on the CIA Triad — not the agency, but the principles:  Confidentiality: Keep data private and protected  Integrity: Prevent unauthorized changes  Availability: Ensure data and systems are accessible when neededPasswords, MFA, and account hygiene are all about confidentiality — preventing unauthorized access to your business’s sensitive information.Final ThoughtsPasswords may feel basic, but they’re central to protecting your business. Combined with MFA and good account hygiene, they form a critical first line of defense.But even the strongest passwords won’t help if someone is tricked into giving them away.Next week, we’ll tackle Social Engineering &amp; AI Threats — how attackers use deception, not just technology, to breach your systems.Stay tuned!",

                    url: "/blog/How-setup-power-monitoring-virtual-machine/",
                    content: "Monitoring power consumption is crucial for making smarter decisions, reducing costs, and promoting sustainability—whether in a data center, smart home, or renewable energy project. A power monitoring virtual machine (VM) simplifies this process by providing a centralized platform to collect, analyze, and visualize energy data.In this blog, we’ll walk you through setting up a power monitoring VM, covering essential tools, software, and configurations to streamline your energy management. Let’s get started and optimize your power monitoring setup!Prerequisites      Virtual Machine Host  You’ll need either VMware ESXi or Proxmox Virtual Environment installed on your server.        UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)  Your UPS should have either a USB or Ethernet port for communication.      Virtual Machine Image  Typically downloadable from the manufacturer’s website, usually in .VMDK format.System Overview  In this example setup:      We have a physical server connected to the UPS using both power and data via USB.        A hypervisor (ESXi or Proxmox) is already installed.        We’ll use the manufacturer’s utility image to deploy the power monitoring VM.    ⚠️ Note: The monitoring system used in this guide supports VMware ESXi only.  Procedures for VMWare        Verify UPS Detection via SSH    - Login to your VMware host through SSH.                      At the prompt, type lsusb. This command will list all USB devices connected to your physical server.                      Download the VMDK image from the manufacturer’s website    For this example, the UPS manufacturer is Cyber Power Systems.    - If your UPS is connected via USB, download the first option.    - If your UPS is connected via the network, download the second (remote) option.                  After downloadingUnzip the file to extract the necessary image files.      Login to the VMware web GUI and create a virtual machine.    Select Deploy a virtual machine from an OVF or OVA file, then click Next.                      Enter the name of the virtual machine (e.g., MonitorVM).    - Drag and drop the .ovf and .vmdk files into the box.    - Click Next once they are loaded.                            Choose the storage location.    For this example, we only have one option. Click Next.                      Select Thin Provisioning.    - Untick Power on automatically.    - Click Next.                      Review the configuration and click Finish.                      Wait for the virtual machine to finish creating.                      Configure the power monitoring VM.    - Add a USB device to the VM.    - Choose your UPS from the list.    - Click Save.                                  Turn on the virtual machine.    Take note of the IP address automatically assigned by ESXi.                      Access the web GUI.    Open a browser and enter the IP address with the correct port (e.g., http://10.11.0.124:3052).    Refer to the manufacturer’s manual to determine the correct port.                            Change the default password (mandatory).    After clicking Save, you will be logged out and must log in again with your new password.                            After logging in, you'll see complete UPS information on the left-hand side.                      Configure shutdown settings.    Navigate to Settings &gt; Shutdown Events.    - Verify connectivity to your ESXi server.    - Set your preferred shutdown duration and delay.                      Click Apply to save your shutdown configurations.                Procedures for Proxmox      In Proxmox, select your PVE node → Shell.     Or use your favorite remote connection tool to connect to your proxmox server. List all USB ports by typing lsusb          Note the Bus and Device of your UPS device.                 List the USB port details:   lsusb -v -s [bus]:[device]   in my case   lsusb -v -s 1:16                      We have to download PowerPanel Business                  We are going to download PowerPanel Business – Virtual Machine (Local) since the UPS is connected directly to our bare-metal server.                     Extract the zipped file to reveal its contents.    We will need the .OVF and .VMDK files later.                      We are going to upload the .OVF and .VMDK files to our Proxmox server using SFTP or FTP software such as FileZilla, WinSCP, etc. In our case, we will use WinSCP. Once downloaded, install it to your device.    Upload the .OVF and .VMDK files to the Proxmox server.Using WinSCP, log in to your Proxmox server and proceed with the upload.                                    Create the virtual machine for CyberPower PowerPanel.In the Proxmox shell, navigate to the directory where you uploaded the .OVF and .VMDK files.              We are now ready to create the virtual machine using the following command format:qm importovf &lt;proxmox ID&gt; &lt;ovf source&gt; &lt;storage&gt; --format &lt;format&gt;  qm – Command that creates/restores a VM  importovf – Imports virtual machines from an OVF (Open Virtualization Format) or OVA (Open Virtual Appliance) package into a hypervisor or virtualization platform  proxmox ID – Assigns a unique Proxmox ID for the virtual machine  ovf source – The path to the OVF source file  storage – Specifies the storage where the virtual machine will reside  --format – Sets the disk format (e.g., raw, qcow2, vmdk)For our case, qm importovf 106 ppb4113-local.ovf local-lvm --format raw              Upon entering the command, the system will display the progress of the VM creation. Wait until it reaches 100%.                  Add a virtual network card and connect the UPS to the VMThe virtual machine is not complete yet—we need to add a virtual network card so we can assign it an IP address later.                                          Check the Manufacturer and Product ID, then select Add.                                Assign an IP address to PowerPanelTurn on the newly created virtual machine.              Since we don't have a working IP address yet, we will assign one using DHCP.First, type ip add to identify the label of the attached network card.              Next, we will activate ens18 by typing the following command:sudo ip link set dev ens18 up              We will assign an IP address automatically using the following command:sudo dhclient -v ens18Upon entering this command, the system will display the assigned IP address.                 Access PowerPanel using the assigned IP address and port 3052Using a browser, we can now access PowerPanel by entering the assigned IP address followed by the port number.In our case, it should be:192.168.5.102:3052                      Upon logging in, the system will prompt you to change the password.Changing the password is mandatory.

    <div class="post-body">
      <p>I fell in love with the idea of Linux when I was 15 or 16 years old. I would read magazines about the Linux operating system and the power of open source, which fascinated me. The idea of a free (free as in freedom and free as in free lunch) operating system that anyone could modify for their own specific needs seemed like a gift from the community to the world. Simply incredible. I wanted to run Linux as my primary operating system, but I was also an aspiring musician and had gone on my first real tour when I was 16. I was working as an assistant engineer in a few recording studios, learning the science of audio engineering in the evenings when I wasn’t in class or on the road playing shows, and I had music software I needed to run, none of which worked on Linux.</p>

<p>Around this time, I also discovered emulators. My mom is handicapped (she would kill me if I said she was disabled) from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and my dad was a counselor for the state. With my mom’s medical bills and her not being able to generate much income, we didn’t have much money growing up. We were certainly rich in everything that really mattered, but we watched our pennies. I still find myself being pretty thrifty these days as a result of that experience. I watched all my friends getting game consoles like Nintendos and Sega Genesis, but that was just more money than my parents could spare. It was a bit frustrating, but then I discovered emulators and I was hooked. An emulator is a piece of software that tricks your computer into thinking it was a game console, so I could play a lot of those games my friends were playing, right on my computer. I became obsessed with making technology do things it wasn’t necessarily supposed to do.</p>

<p>Then, in the late 90’s heard about an UC Berkley startup called VMware that would allow you to run multiple operating systems on one physical host or computer. The person who started the project saw that, in general, servers weren’t fully utilizing all the CPU, RAM, and hard drive space that they had available. They speculated that they could turn one physical server into multiple virtual servers somehow, and that turned into the concept for a hypervisor.</p>

<p>A hypervisor is an operating system (Windows is the most used operating system for desktop computers and Android on smartphones now is the most popular operating system) that lives on a piece of hardware, like a server, in which you can create virtual computers or machines. Virtual machines are very powerful technology. Essentially, you’ve wrapped a whole computer in one or two files, so you can copy those files all over the place, keep them safe, and move them between multiple hosts in real time without any downtime. It’s rather amazing technology that still feels like magic to me even after all these years, and I thoroughly enjoyed being able to work on that technology in my adult career full-time.</p>

<p>In one edition of some Linux magazine, there was an ad for VMware and a phone number, so I just called them on the phone and someone actually answered. They were a tiny startup. We discussed Linux and music software and how I could find a way to run both. I was just a dumb kid who didn’t know what he was doing, but it was still amazing that they would just talk to me. At the time, I didn’t get to dig into VMware as much as I would have liked; that would come later. I had no idea when I was 16 that I would be able to have a career in both music technology and corporate IT and how well they actually worked together.</p>

<p>I simply fell in love with VMware and the concepts, and as my IT knowledge grew, so did VMware as a company. They certainly had their share of changes in their business as Dell bought them, and they were bought and sold to other companies, but they always managed to navigate the technology landscape in a way that was very good for their users. Most of their users were people like me, server administrators who wanted to squeeze the most performance out of the servers they were working on for their clients. VMware is the backend that powers the world, and almost no one outside of tech circles has heard of them. They make billions of dollars a year now, not bad from a little startup that would answer some 16-year-old kid’s silly questions on the phone for free.</p>

<p>Sadly, a huge conglomerate called Broadcom purchased VMware outright, and it seems their intentions are to raise prices to a ridiculous level, remove any perpetual licensing, and just focus on the absolute largest companies in the world. They’ve made decisions that leave small businesses out of the discussion entirely. Personally, I am increasingly frustrated with this subscription-based world we find ourselves in. I think you should be able to buy software once and use it on your server or computers forever. I hate that you have to pay a monthly fee to use software that you have paid for in the past. VMware’s new licensing model makes it so you will have to pay a subscription on your server forever, or your virtual servers stop working. I didn’t think that was an ethical decision, and VMware’s response to the industry criticisms has been that “Subscription pricing is the industry standard.” I don’t think that’s an acceptable answer, and I don’t care what everyone else does. You need to make the right decision for yourself, and aren’t technology leaders supposed to lead regardless of industry? That’s something I appreciated about Steve Jobs and Apple at the time that he ran it. He didn’t care what the industry was doing; he was going to do what he thought was right and what he thought would make the most sense for his end-users.</p>

<p>I fear that there’s a larger trend in the tech industry that I’m increasingly unhappy with. I describe it as the tail wagging the dog. All of these tools - servers, hypervisors, printers - are tools to do something in a business, to run the business, to make the business more profitable, to make it work in some way. It seems very backward to me for a tool to dictate the business, rather than the business dictate the use of the tool that it has chosen. It seems that the tech industry has gotten a little too big for its britches, in my opinion, and has decided that they are so vital and important to business as a whole. In some cases, it’s hard to argue. Microsoft Outlook has been the email platform for business for years, despite it not necessarily being the greatest product, but certainly, we can’t be held hostage by these tech companies. We can’t fall into the subscription trap of forever payments for not that much value back other than things keep working.</p>

<p>That’s why, after 20 years of being a VMware administrator, we have decided at Mastiff to not do any new VMware projects. We will certainly maintain, upgrade, and take care of our existing VMware install’s, but we will migrate away from VMware in the future. We are moving to a hypervisor product called Proxmox that does a fantastic job for most of what we need and is fully open source, so they won’t ever really have that problem where a big company buys them out. I have personally played with Proxmox off and on for a few years now, and its latest version is quite mature. We also do a lot with Hyper-V, the Microsoft product, and of course, Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS platforms.</p>

<p>We also refuse to install or move to Nutanix, the possible up-and-comer to replace VMware in the corporate world, as they too don’t have perpetual licensing and cost roughly the same as VMware is raising its prices to. Nutanix will trick you with amazing first-year pricing, but then you are trapped, and it’s no better than VMware, and VMware is the more mature product. I hear Nutanix reps give the same line “subscription pricing is industry standard” and it turns my stomach to hear. What a cop out. I thought tech companies didn’t follow the pack? We will work on Nutanix but we wont do a new install with it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our days with VMware are numbered due to them clearly not wanting to take care of small business users’ needs. It’s quite heartbreaking for me, as I’ve loved this technology since I was a teenager, but it seems like there are, at least from a business standpoint, greener pastures elsewhere. We always want to be at the forefront of new technology that can be disruptive to the industry, so it’ll be an interesting few years. Hopefully, this will go down in history as a big giant business mistake for Broadcom and VMware, and companies will learn not to be so disruptive to their users’ everyday lives. Once again, open source saves the day!</p>

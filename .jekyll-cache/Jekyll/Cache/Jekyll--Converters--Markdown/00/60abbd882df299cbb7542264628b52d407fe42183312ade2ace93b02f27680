I"Ï<p>I have two of my kids on my car insurance since itâ€™s cheaper for them, so they pay
me directly for it every month rather than pay the bill themselves. I also had them
on my phone plan up until recently. But itâ€™s easy to forget to request that payment
and the kids certainly arenâ€™t motivated to remember. Certainly there was a way to
automate this?</p>

<p>My solution after a lot of trial and error was to use the shortcuts app to create an
automation to request the payment via Apple Pay.</p>

<p>As you can see for my kids. One shortcut each. Then I created a recurring
reminder with a link to the shortcut.</p>

<p>I get a pop up reminder on the first of every month, and I just click on the reminder
and it runs the shortcut and requests the money. The system works pretty well and
I havenâ€™t forgotten to ask them since.</p>
